Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses.

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",t2_1t70,False,,3,False,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",[],r/depression,False,,,0,,False,t3_doqwow,False,dark,1.0,,public,2359,304,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2359,,False,True,,False,,[],"{'gid_1': 23, 'gid_2': 3}",,True,,1572360722.0,text,,,,text,self.depression,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say &amp;quot;PM me anytime&amp;quot; in a casual social context.  &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I’m 27 years old and I have chronic end stage liver disease due to alcoholism. That’s it I guess. I've been a heavy drinker ever since I turned 21 due to untreated depression and mental health issues. Alcoholism has run rampant thru multiple generations of my family on both sides.

May 5th 2022 was my final drink and the day I almost drank myself to death leading to a hospitalization jaundiced and feeling awful.

My numbers have been coming down ever so slowly and I've had countless imaging, bloodwork and regular check ups since being diagnosed. Initially I was on the transplant list.

I started drinking a liter of vodka per day since I turned 21. This was due to financial impacts on me and my dad being a useless alcoholic himself (though he did provide very well for our family and stayed sober from when I was in 8th grade up until we all moved out) My brother is 7 years older than I am. My dad was a very successful transportation superintendent who’s alcoholism ultimately led to his and subsequently my downfall. He’s now a journeyman diesel mechanic for bnsf all thanks to his union backing him since he started nearly 30 years ago by just paying his union dues alone. That guy ruined my life as an upcoming adult out of high school in 2013. He would drink, call me, yell at me, tell me I was failing, turned my siblings against me.

We’re all on the path of recovery as a family in general. I just happened to get hit with the hardest blow through no wrong doing of my own. Unfortunate but truthful.

I sort of had a struggling with feeling like life had no meaning if I wasn’t intoxicated in some way. I feel generally unmotivated to work or do anything in my life that requires effort. I have thought for a long time I possibly had undiagnosed ADHD as a child which also led me down a path thinking I may be slightly on the spectrum. My cousin on my dads side was diagnosed with autism and removed from our family shortly thereafter due to my aunt not wanting my uncle to succumb to the families history of alcoholic abuse. My dad has always been a weird weird guy. He does not show emotion, he does not know how to have an intellectual conversation, he doesn’t know some basic human interactions and has no self awareness. However, he is one of the most intricate and mechanically inclined individuals I’ve ever met. This guy built a home by himself top to bottom meticulously putting it together piece by piece nail by nail. This took him 5 years. We ended up selling the house and moving 7 miles down the road. This is where he would take on his “new projects” as he liked to put it. Restoration of cars, literal speed boats made by hand, fiberglass’d by himself.

 It's a very long waiting process and each appointment is far away and I eagerly await for more news. So that’s the story I guess lol. Don’t be dumb kids.

Things went downhill solidly for me last year with the divorce and being promoted into a job that I truly hate. I hit a wall and cannot seem to push past it.

,depression,"I always picture a smile on my face everytime I fantasise my death. I believe I will truly be at peace after that. 

Everytime I drive or walk past a bus I wonder how quickly I would die if I was under that bus. I picture my body with a smile on my face, its almost as if dying a quick death, and an accident has solved all of my problems and that thought brings me peace I would never have otherwise. I have always toyed with the idea of killing myself regularly but I don't want to bring myself to do that because that would cause misery to everyone around me. I want to die in an accident, so that everyone will wonder how unfortuate I was, but I would just be glad it happened. I have nothing to live for, I have a sibling so my parents won't feel entirely hopeless.

Man, how I wish I had cancer or any terminal illness, that would be a cheat code to end my suffering. I look at all of the people who have survived the worst and I think, how do they not want the easy way out, why do they fight so hard? What do they have to live for? I truly admire their desire and strength, but that will never be me. I am the coward who will nope out real quick because I don't want to fight to live this worthless existance. 

I am currently working but I have plans of shifting to start a masters degree in another country. I'm questioning all of these decisions right now because if I can't handle myself here, with my family around, I will definitely not be able to do it when I'm alone.

I believe I will truly be at peace after that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everytime I drive or walk past a bus I wonder how quickly I would die if I was under that bus. I picture my body with a smile on my face, its almost as if dying a quick death, and an accident has solved all of my problems and that thought brings me peace I would never have otherwise. I have always toyed with the idea of killing myself regularly but I don&amp;#39;t want to bring myself to do that because that would cause misery to everyone around me. I want to die in an accident, so that everyone will wonder how unfortuate I was, but I would just be glad it happened. I have nothing to live for, I have a sibling so my parents won&amp;#39;t feel entirely hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man, how I wish I had cancer or any terminal illness, that would be a cheat code to end my suffering. I look at all of the people who have survived the worst and I think, how do they not want the easy way out, why do they fight so hard? What do they have to live for? I truly admire their desire and strength, but that will never be me. I am the coward who will nope out real quick because I don&amp;#39;t want to fight to live this worthless existance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently working but I have plans of shifting to start a masters degree in another country. I&amp;#39;m questioning all of these decisions right now because if I can&amp;#39;t handle myself here, with my family around, I will definitely not be able to do it when I&amp;#39;m alone.

The past 3 years I have been dealing with an existencial anxiety that follows me most of the day.

3 years ago I become conscious of myself, well, I was forced to after someone I liked told me how many people I had hurt with my actions.

I felt guilty, ashamed, I hated me and my past actions, thoughts and attitudes. But I didn't tried to change. 

Instead I denied that feeling, I didn't acknowledged what I did nor the consequences of it. 

So I started acting, in a way directly opposite of my errors and faults, I choose engineering as my career to hide how stupid I felt about myself, I smiled and become friends with everyone to hide how lonely I felt, I lied, lied and lied some more. 

And now, the snowball of my lies is about to crush me and I realize I should have never lied or acted like someone I'm not, instead I should have accepted my errors and try to change and learn from them, not hide and scape, you can't scape from your own mind.

,depression,"It has been pretty difficult to get out of bed. I’ve passed the worst of it when it comes to quitting cigarettes I believe. No alcohol either. I’m feeling like I’m doing well progression-wise. 

I’m so angry. The more the nicotine and dopamine leaves my body, the more inset my feelings of rage and depression become. I read somewhere that there is an internal balancing act that is destroyed when a person is in such a state: the inner child’s longing, the inner teen’s thirst for revenge, and the current adult’s desire for peace. I feel each of those feelings very distinctly. I get so angry and sad when I think about all of the betrayals I’ve faced. All the times I was left lonely during the worst points in my life. I long for that love I never had in my life. A truly unconditional love and quest for understanding only a well adjusted mature parent could give a child that no longer exists. I crave revenge on the immature parents and family structure I have in reality. There's a high level of rage I feel on a daily basis following my sadness on account of the raw deal that formed my deeply flawed personality of the present. I want to throw shit, punch a wall, choke someone unconscious. Then the next minute I want to curl in a ball and cry the tears that refuse to come out of my face. After my failed attempts at releasing the emotions physically, I then continue exercising, stretching, and reading regularly so my physical state does not reflect my mental one. 

In every single year of my life I faced suffering. Suffering out of my control in my childhood and adolescence and suffering I committed upon myself in the form of weed abuse, alcohol abuse, and nicotine dependence in my adulthood. I thought earlier today in the shower that, if I had the choice, if there were no serious consequences, if I had the money, I could and would remain high every minute of every day until I died. If I didn’t join the military, if my mind wouldn’t be at risk of declining into psychosis, if I never had a bad high, I would never be sober again. If I could drink and still drive, still function at work, still complete my school work and exercise, jog and eat, have invincible kidneys and an ever present alcoholic buzz just enough to block my negative thoughts and bring back my innocence, I would drink every minute of every day until the day I died. And because I can’t do those things while also pursuing activities that *actually* make me happy, I resorted to smoking cigarettes all day, cigars all day, both everyday to have that buzz that eliminated every negative emotion that snuck up on me when I least expected it. However, I finally realized it essentially had the same negative effect. I would not be able to do such a thing all day everyday, block out only those emotions which are negative while only feeling the emotions that resemble positivity, and still pursue the activities that *actually* make me happy. If I indulged in such things, the unhappy pattern of my life would only continue until my death. A death that would come much sooner than I want, and probably cut off my progress as a human being at the knees (figuratively if not literally as well due to my family history of kidney failure, diabetes, heart disease, and mental health issues on top of addictive personality disorders.) 

I am at least appreciative of the fact I’ve done enough reading in areas that are completely unrelated to my ultimate education goal in life to fully understand that I cannot do the previously mentioned unhealthy coping strategies without being constantly aware of the unhealthiness of such smoking and drinking used to blank my mind. An empty mind does not equal a healthy one. It does not lend itself well to being emotionally mature and well adjusted.

,depression,"For as long as I can remember, I've never been a particularly happy person and suffered from severe social anxiety and anxiety in general. It was fine for most of my life tho. I was functional and appeared normal on the outside. My mood got worse about 8 yrs ago tho when my family moved to europe from a middle eastern country. Didn't make any friend, lonely af, sad, constantly obsessing over anxious pointless thoughts, uno the drill. Got gradually worse for the last 8 yrs. I was still functional tho, so much so that I somehow managed to force myself to study enough to get into med. Apart from the first year, which wasn't so bad, it only got worse from there however. For 2nd, 3rd and now 4th yr of my course I gradually lost any motivation, joy in things I enjoyed or fucks to give I had for anything. I had to repeat all exams in summer for all those years. I would sparsely attend and barely study. In fact I havent studied at all this entire 4th year. It got to a point that for the last 2 years I barely left my bed. Did not care about anything or anyone. I was pretty close with my sister, but even tho im sure she loved me, I stopped caring about her. Same with my parents and the only 2 friends I got. Its a weird unexpected part of depression I didnt expect. You might also relate to the numbness I started feeling. I was sad, I guess, but mostly numb and apathetic toward everything.

For the last year, I slowly started fantasizing about suicide. I didnt wanna do it, but I wanted to stop existing, its called a passive death wish. I enjoyed thinking about it I think cuz it gave me a way out. Who doesnt like thinking about solutions to their problems, ugm? I had a whole plan. Knew a website where I could order Carbon monoxide tank and I knew I could sneak out an oxygen mask from the hospital I was attached to as a medical student. You can imagine the rest. I even wrote up individualised notes for any person i cared about. Pretty fucked up. Even called the Smaritans cuz I dont know why. Multiple times. I never would've imagined I would. Had absolutely no belief in myself getting better.

That was until I sought a GP appointment as a last hail Mary a month ago. It has changed my life. Not an understatement at all. He prescribed sertraline 50mg daily and it has shocked me with how well it has worked. It just magically (cuz it was so spontaneous) improved my mood and motivation. I cleaned my room and took my first shower in months (idk how long exactly tbh). Started just going on walks just to get outside for hours a day. After 2 weeks I even got the motivation to start gym and now its the FIRST THING I DO when I wake up in the morning. I actually get out of bed too so thats nice. It is mind blowing to me how much of my depression just had to do with not enough seretonin between my neurons' synapses. Its crazy. Im still only starting, I still spend most of my time in bed and havent starting studying. However, I feel better than I ever have and am fully convinced I will get out of this.

That's what I wanna focus on. Cuz not every one is lucky enough to get better with the first antidepressant they try like this. And I truly feel for the hopelessness treatment resistant patients must feel. But I just wanted to emphasis that this is part of your depression. I haven't felt this confident in myself in ages. I have just spontanously gone from being convinced I will kill my self in a few years to having an unshakable belief I will do well. Its all just chemicals in your brain. If and when (hopefully) you get better, your entire prespective changes. Nothing about my life has changed significantly apart from how I feel, yet my beliefs of my future have been completely flipped. You start noticing the small amount of joy you get even in menial chores that most people don't even realise we feel. It's just meant to be normal. You notice the small amount of joy you get from seeing the sun shining on grass and tiny things like that you don't realise until its gone and given back to you. You have belief in yourself and that motivates you to actually do stuff. When looking at a bunch of people outside laughing, you dont feel sad, you feel nice. Ever step or chore doesnt feel like effort, it feels interesting. The lack of all of this and more is what makes you and I barely want to move while most people go out and do stuff with their lives.

This has helped me immensely in stopping me from blaming myself. Anyone telling you, you are lazy (often just yourself) is wrong. They have many of the aforementioned stuff in their head already. it allows them to live life easier than you who does not experience this stuff. That's the difference. Not that you are lazy, weak or whatever. Like I am only able to go from crying on the floor to gym every morning and wanting to type all of this because of a small chemical modification in my brain. And I havent forced myself to do any of this. I started enjoying it. I like getting out of bed in the morning. I like running in the gym, even while dying of breathlessness. I like my arms quivering as I lift. I like walking outside while jamming to some music. I'm finding minimal, but genuine joy in every sentence I type. It's actually interesting. All of this would have been nothing but pure effort before Sertraline. It's just chemicals in your brain, not your fault.

I hope this helps in mustering some hope. This place is mostly filled with depressing posts so I thought I might switch it up a bit. Please try to pursue any leads you have that might make you get better. It is so worth it. You don't realize how deep you were and how good normalcy feels till you get better.

,depression,"I’ve been getting worse and worse over the past year. I have always been the stone, the rock in peoples lives. The most mature and the one everyone would go to for advice because it seems like I had it together. But recently I’ve been becoming numb, phasing in and out and coming back after someone had been talking to me.

I’m fighting off intrusive thoughts daily now—-I’m beginning to think they’re actually just *my* thoughts. I have clung onto hope for a better life for 20 years or more. And it’s just getting more and more difficult. More and more health issues. More people breaking my trust. More trauma getting stirred up. 

The only time I find joy is when I’m with my son. In my journaling, it’s very consistent that he’s the only reason I won’t let myself think too long on dying. Actually, you might say I am actively working to die because I have health issues I simply *cannot* deal with, despite being at high risk because of family history. 

I’m crying out for help. I just texted my husband today that I don’t know how much longer I can keep doing this and I feel hopeless and his response is like “ugh yeah i know it sucks”. And listen…I’m so grateful he doesn’t suffer with depression or anxiety. I imagine it’s hard to relate to if you’ve never experienced it first hand. But is this really all the support there is?

,depression,"Some context for this: 
I am not officially diagnosed with any mental health illness partly because I’m a bit afraid to because I know my family (who are 100% supportive of everything except mental health) will take it personally. Secondly because really I just want to keep it to myself because I can just about get by in day to day life and I know a diagnosis would affect me badly.
I am currently doing a PGCE (teacher training) and almost done as it’s only a year. On one of our University days we had a focus on mental health (ours and the children) and one of our tasks my lecturer set was to draw a tree. We were told to include roots, soil, trunk, leaves, branches, flowers and fruits.

Now, literally everyone except me drew a standard tree drawing - roots, soil, big straight trunk, big cloud-like top etc. (hope that makes sense!) I on the other hand, drew a weeping willow - no roots because somehow I couldn’t bring myself to draw them, a little line for the soil, a straight, average trunk, no branches, and the leaves were just a cascade of light downward shading which mostly obscured the trunk, I did draw some little blue flowers on it after some thought. After I drew this, my lecturer was coming round the tables to see what everyone had drawn. I thought mine was terrible anyway and tried my best to hide it, but when she saw how very different mine was to everyone else she took a great interest and sat next to me and started asking me questions about my life etc. which I absolutely hated because I never want to talk about myself, let alone to someone I barely know. But I admitted to her I struggle with feeling really empty and isolated and she suggested I seek help which I will not be doing. 

But what I need to know is, is it really so obvious I’m struggling mentally, even from that? I just need some advice and thoughts really.

So here I am 22 years old struggling with everything.

Since I remember I had difficulties in social interactions and making friends or fitting in.   
Growing up as the fat kid people always tended to make fun of me, which made me isolate myself more and more as i grew up, I however at one point decided to hit the gym and improve myself to be liked by others, while knowing this is a never ending process I think i made quite an improvement in both my physical and educational appearence. Thinking that after school and with going to an university everything would finally change.

At the same time i felt in love for the first time just for it to turn out that the this girl was using me to get revenge of one of my cousin, which she dated. After my situation not changing at all i decided to leave all that behind and start a new life in europe, choosing the same major again and literally throwing 2 semesters away. However even after changing my place again I horrybly failed at making friends over the past 4 years. Also over the time with failing 2 more failed relations I started to notice that over the past months for me more and more life became meaningless and sort of a joke. Thus people i occasionally hang out with telling me that I cannot take nothing serious no more, but they dont realiaze that at this point im so numb. It just feels like these days people have become so superficial and woke and once you dont give them what you want or don´t act like it is expected you are a piece of shit.

,depression,"“Depression is a disease, you shouldn’t be ashamed”

I know. If only the world sees it that way though. 

They only see failure. A disappointment. They look at you like you are lazy, incapable, pitiful. 

At a certain age, all they start to talk is about career, achievements, buying a house, a car, luxury vacation. I can’t talk about myself without making things up to defend myself why I haven’t achieved anything like they have. It’s so exhausting &amp; just traumatizing even. I feel like a fraud making excuses for being a failure. When it’s my turn to talk, they all look careful not to offend me, but doesn’t make it any better. Awkwardly changing to other subjects. 

Socializing supposed to make you feel better. But only when you are young, teenagers or very early 20s. After that, your lives become so different. Everyone else is way ahead of you in life, and they can see you are still struggling as always. 

I would loveee to move somewhere new. New circle of friends, start fresh. But too broke for that.

,depression,"I'm in my first year of university and currently in the midst of exams. I have two exams left and three days to study. I was doing really well this term up until mid-March when I hit a wall with my depression. I don't think it was anything in particular, probably a culmination of being away from home so long and the realization that I'm on my own for the rest of my life. I stopped going to my classes, fell behind on chores and only really left my dorm to go to work and my mandatory labs. Essentially, I can't find any motivation to study or even get out of bed now that classes and labs are over. I took quite a few days off work to study, so I don't have that motivating me anymore. Honestly I just don't know what to do. (Trigger warning) I started self-harming again, which I really hate myself for. I feel like even though I've worked my whole life for this opportunity, I'm wasting it because I have a stupid illness that has no cure, and that just makes it worse. 

I want to get better and do well on my finals but I honestly don't know how.

Havent been to university yet, never dated, i have no skills and nothing im passionate about. I wake up everything and i have no sense of direction. I dont have a hobby that is valuable in any way and even if it were, i dont put enough time and effort into anything for it to be of some value.  Im not particularly attractive in personality or appearance.  I usually have nothing to add to conversations as i havent had many experiences in life.

I have cut contact with most of my school friends because im sick of the questions about what im up to. Im up to nothing. Im not having a good time or partying or working towards a degree or career or partner. Its okay to not do these things if youre Enjoying your time being unemployed and shit.

I have one friend. We're online friends. I consider them my best friend. Unfortunately,  im starting to feel ashamed of talking to them about trivial matters about my days. We've been friends since 2016 and i havent moved an inch ahead in my life. It was alright for a bit when covid happened. Things werent going at a normal pace for my friend too, then, because of covid. 

Now, though, things are starting to change for my friend. Im happy but i also feel like a total failure. My friend is studying what they love, they are great at the skill they've been working on even before we became friends. They have friends, live in a more accepting country (we are both queer), things are going well for them. Recently they started talking to someone they seem to be interested in romantically.  And they say the person is very interesting. And though i know its not an attack at me for being boring lol but i Know im quite boring. You wouldnt say im an interesting person.

In the past three years I've seen at least five new therapists/ two new psychiatrists and they have also observed traces of PTSD and obsession. I have been on at least 3-4 different kinds of antidepressants and anxiety medicines, including SSRIs in the past seven years and none of them have ever made a difference, the only effect they'd have on me was to make me extremely loopy and I felt drained all the time. Now, because of the side effects and not seeing any changes at all even after consuming the medicines for 1-2 months over and over and over with different combinations, after a point I just stop taking these medicines. I am honestly demotivated and tired. 

Last year I was in a rather toxic relationship, throughout the relationship I felt like I was emotionally neglected and gaslighted and even when the relationship ended my ex kept love bombing me making it extremely difficult for me to move on. This ultimately lead to extreme depression and I tried to kill myself. I had to take a semester off, and I've been in therapy since. I have been put on three different combinations of escitalopram, clonazepam, quetiapine and sodium valproate in the past seven months, and they still didn't work.

One good thing is that I have finally found a therapist who is compatible and I really look forward to the sessions and it feels like we might actually make progress. My therapist has strongly advised me to NOT STOP TAKING THE MEDICATIONS suddenly, no matter what. Also, in our last session, they did mention a possible bipolar diagnosis, but can only confirm after a few more sessions. The problem is, my last session was almost two weeks ago since they had to take some time off, but I'm still on antidepressants.

,depression,"28, depression for 18 years. And all that time, I've hated brushing my teeth. Not ""I'm depressed and don't care about my appearance"", though that was abundant too, but specifically brushing my teeth I hated. Avoided it and now my teeth are all messed up. I've never really understood my aversion but I had an epiphany and I wanna know if it actually makes sense to anyone, or if they feel the same way. 

Brushing my teeth reminds me I exist. Not as strongly, but I dislike showering and shaving, I only eat when I'm hungry or sleep when I'm tired, no schedules or routines, and I avoid ever seeing my reflection. 
I'm wondering if these things that are meant for maintaining a fleshy bag that I hate so much wake me from the delirium I prefer to live in where I'm just a brain experiencing things. Movies, reading, petting a dog, engaging my senses doesn't remind me I have a body, but actively working to take care of and prolong the existence of a body I hate so much... Those 2-3 minutes of brushing are torture. 
Does that make sense? I've always been in the ""god, it'd be lovely if I was dead"" but not usually actually suicidal. My brain tortures me, but I escape it by doing things. Again, movies, books, especially ones I've seen a million times, but I've spent my life avoiding thinking about myself as an actual person because I hate that person. And the actions that force me to take care of myself remind me I'm that guy I hate. 
I mean, also to a lesser sense I'm ""eh I'll be dead in a few years, who cares about my teeth"" but I've been saying that for nearly two decades. But does the hating being reminded I have a body make sense? I just had two teeth pulled so I'm also on some T3s, so I could just be weird and out of it, especially as I'm rambling at 5am. I'll stop now.

&lt;p&gt;Brushing my teeth reminds me I exist. Not as strongly, but I dislike showering and shaving, I only eat when I&amp;#39;m hungry or sleep when I&amp;#39;m tired, no schedules or routines, and I avoid ever seeing my reflection. 
I&amp;#39;m wondering if these things that are meant for maintaining a fleshy bag that I hate so much wake me from the delirium I prefer to live in where I&amp;#39;m just a brain experiencing things. Movies, reading, petting a dog, engaging my senses doesn&amp;#39;t remind me I have a body, but actively working to take care of and prolong the existence of a body I hate so much... Those 2-3 minutes of brushing are torture. 
Does that make sense? I&amp;#39;ve always been in the &amp;quot;god, it&amp;#39;d be lovely if I was dead&amp;quot; but not usually actually suicidal. My brain tortures me, but I escape it by doing things. Again, movies, books, especially ones I&amp;#39;ve seen a million times, but I&amp;#39;ve spent my life avoiding thinking about myself as an actual person because I hate that person. And the actions that force me to take care of myself remind me I&amp;#39;m that guy I hate. 
I mean, also to a lesser sense I&amp;#39;m &amp;quot;eh I&amp;#39;ll be dead in a few years, who cares about my teeth&amp;quot; but I&amp;#39;ve been saying that for nearly two decades. But does the hating being reminded I have a body make sense? I just had two teeth pulled so I&amp;#39;m also on some T3s, so I could just be weird and out of it, especially as I&amp;#39;m rambling at 5am. I&amp;#39;ll stop now.
Hope everyone out there feels better! Just remember: no matter how bad things get, there&amp;#39;s a guy out there who believes you&amp;#39;re better than him. And that guy is probably gunna go to sleep now.&lt;/p&gt;

So I'm 20 and have been struggling with social anxiety and depression for about 5 years now. At school I never had someone, I was always the outsider, never had friends and this continued through my Life. I've been becoming more Numb, went to therapy a few times, was in a clinic for half a year, started cutting myself.   
I have a job and the the People there are nice, they aren't friends tho, I couldn't care less about them. Yk the kind of people you only see at work. They could all die and I wouldn't care, just like most people in my life. The few friends I got are online.  
So I met someone at work who seemed nice, we started chatting etc. Long Story short I mad the mistake to roughly reveal a bit about my struggles and now she wants nothing more to do with me anymore.

,depression,"So my (F21) grandma is around 60+ of age and ever since she was a child, she's been taught to do so much chores around the house. At first, it wasn't too bad since I was around to help but now that i've gone to college that is so far away, she's all on her own without any or much help. I feel like its taking a big toll on her health. We have a part time maid that comes around to clean a couple times a week but the maid could only do a few ""big"" chores like mopping and sweeping around the house (we live in a bungalow so many areas to cover).  


Everyone else in the house are basically useless pieces of shit except for my mom and grandad. My grandad helps with buying groceries and other smaller chores whenever he feels like it lol and my mom is at work 24/7. She goes to work at 8am and comes home at 1am. She even works on the weekends so she's not around to be much of help. My dad is not existent. My younger brother is the laziest and shittiest human being on earth, he's 16 but acts like he's fucking 6. Everything must be told to do or else it wouldn't get done. He's a brat and argues a lot and overall a trash human being. My older sibling (M23) is a fucking r4P15T that should be in prison and die but instead stays at home for free (he goes to work from morning to night as well) and should've been kicked out since he's old enough to fuck off.  


Idk how or why there's so many damn chores around the house but my grandma gets up at 415am in the morning, washes everyone's clothes and does everything else non stop without any sort of rest whatsoever until maybe in the afternoon around 3pm where she lays down to get a short nap in and wakes up to continue her chores until the night at 11pm. Its all the chores including preparing the meals, washing stuff, ironing clothes and idk what else honestly. She's fallen a few times and it has hurt her leg so much that it's swollen and her knees ache but even when asked to rest, she keeps saying that no one else would do the chores and it would never get done if she rests. She doesnt go on holidays because of these chores and hates the idea of piled up clothes after a holiday cause she would be the one washing everyone else's clothes. I feel so bad and guilty, we cant afford a permanent maid either and its very stressful for me to see her overwork  herself to exhaustion. Even when she's sick and really unwell, she'd push herself to get it done.  


If you think she enjoys it, she doesn't. She always gets angry due to the lack of help and because of my younger brother being an asshole for not listening. She cries a lot and is basically in depression and has high blood pressure because of all this. She thinks everyone treats her like a maid and doesn’t respect her.

My older sibling (M23) is a fucking r4P15T that should be in prison and die but instead stays at home for free (he goes to work from morning to night as well) and should&amp;#39;ve been kicked out since he&amp;#39;s old enough to fuck off.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Idk how or why there&amp;#39;s so many damn chores around the house but my grandma gets up at 415am in the morning, washes everyone&amp;#39;s clothes and does everything else non stop without any sort of rest whatsoever until maybe in the afternoon around 3pm where she lays down to get a short nap in and wakes up to continue her chores until the night at 11pm. Its all the chores including preparing the meals, washing stuff, ironing clothes and idk what else honestly. She&amp;#39;s fallen a few times and it has hurt her leg so much that it&amp;#39;s swollen and her knees ache but even when asked to rest, she keeps saying that no one else would do the chores and it would never get done if she rests. She doesnt go on holidays because of these chores and hates the idea of piled up clothes after a holiday cause she would be the one washing everyone else&amp;#39;s clothes. I feel so bad and guilty, we cant afford a permanent maid either and its very stressful for me to see her overwork  herself to exhaustion. Even when she&amp;#39;s sick and really unwell, she&amp;#39;d push herself to get it done.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think she enjoys it, she doesn&amp;#39;t. She always gets angry due to the lack of help and because of my younger brother being an asshole for not listening. She cries a lot and is basically in depression and has high blood pressure because of all this. She thinks everyone treats her like a maid and doesn’t respect her. I really want to find ways to help or something, it&amp;#39;s stressing me out so much seeing her this way.&lt;/p&gt;

It feels frustrating because she is very talkative with my older brother and always approaches him, even though he does nothing for her and doesn&amp;#39;t care about her, meanwhile, I do a lot for her and I care about her a lot but she rarely talks to me and doesn&amp;#39;t show appreciation for me. I&amp;#39;ve tried cutting off communication with my cousin but I still find myself going back to her and seeing if she needs help with anything. It&amp;#39;s been a huge problem for me as it&amp;#39;s been driving me to depression and it makes me sad everyday. Do you guys have any advice for me?&lt;/p&gt;

We both have our special interests. But he's also a mean, foul piece of sht and honestly, I don't have empathy for him because I don't believe anything justifies bullying and abusing people. I think he targets me because he knows I have autism and for some reason hates that. He is in his early 20s. He is a gearhead who can fix cars. He also loves wood working and I admire his skills. He is nice to my parents so my parents like him and don't believe he bullies me even though he has spat abuse at me in their presence a few times. His behaviour issues have gotten him in trouble with police - He was taken by police last year for online misdemeanours. But I believe he is let off the hook or his bad behaviour is ignored because he has autism.

I do not live with my parents but I visit them to have dinner about twice a month. I lived with my parents briefly in the 2010s after college and in that time he started bullying me.

Things he has done:

Hurled abuse at me from his family's driveway multiple times (He lives with his parents)

Revved the car and leaned on the car horn

If I was in my bedroom and had the window open for the fresh air, he would go in his backyard and shout abuse at me from there.

Today I had dinner at my parents house. He was in the backyard and so was I. I was spacing out and enjoying all the birds in the yard. My dad noticed and mimicked the sound of a chickadee that was chirping. I laughed, I said ""There's so many birds!"" And it was a nice moment. Then guy spat from over the fence ""Fing weirdo! F HER!""

I can't do any petty revenge stuff on him because I know he would target my family to hurt me and do awful stuff. He would escalate things. So I left my phone recorder on and I got him yesterday. I will probably have my phone recorder on every time I'm at my parents house because of him. And maybe eventually I'll take it to the police. But I doubt they'll do anything cause it's petty stuff, just verbal abuse, not anything physical.

I am having a hard time. I feel no sense of safety or identity because of this guy. I don't feel like a person anymore.

,depression,"Throughout my entire time in school (save a few years in middle school where I was in a special ADHD program and actually made a few friends and felt happy) I never was able to truly connect with anyone else, and the few “friends” I did have I was the last choice to be with. The second someone else- anyone else would show up they would leave me in an instant and pretend like I wasn’t even there. Even trying to join them proved fruitless.

But throughout all those years of feeling horrible and neglected I held on to one hope. In college it was all going to change, people are different in college. People are more accepting and less judgmental, and I’d finally have that friend group that I always dreamed of having.

Everything after the pandemic seems to have just raced by so fast and I can no longer put off the “going out and making friends” that I thought I could do later because I was scared to do it. Online classes had made me complacent.

I’m 20 turning 21 soon but mentally I’m still 18. The only difference is that elevated hope for the future I felt (which was honestly the happiest and most exciting feeling I’ve ever felt) has disappeared completely and I don’t want to continue living anymore.

I have 2 more years of college left but I’m already so old, everyone I meet is either 18 or 19 because after 20 people leave the college dorms and get less involved in it but stay with the friends they’ve already made.

Why would I continue living???? To get a job and work a 9-5 until I die??? If its hard to make friends now making them as an adult is literally an impossible task.

,depression,"Before I start:
I am supposed to be taking a mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder but I haven’t began to take it yet. I’m pretty sure I’m diagnosed with it but I have no clue about my medical records or anything so yeah. This is just an fyi because I wanna be as honest as I can before getting into this.

Let’s start: 
I’m 20 yrs old and a female. I haven’t told anyone this ever, but I am actually debilitatingly obsessed with my self image. I look in the mirror and I don’t see myself as ugly, I think I’m really pretty, but I can see people’s reactions to me and how little attention I get from guys and stuff like that and I just think I’m ugly. 

In my head, I think people see me as deformed, and whenever I go out to a party or am around people, I try to hide my left side of my face as much as possible with my hair or by moving my hands and my face in a way that people can’t see that side because I think it’s probably the part of me that is deformed.

I have always been part of the “popular” crowd in school and now in the real world, but only because of the girls. I make friends pretty easily, but for most of my life, the popular guys who were friends with my girl friends treated me like shit and outright disrespected me or ignored me. Ive always thought this to be because I was ugly. Even though I don’t see myself as that, and in pictures I think I look pretty.

I don’t even know how to explain how I feel but it’s just so scary. I’ve tried to shift my energy and be confident to see if it’s that, but it’s almost like I get ocd about the topic, and it ends up driving me crazy. 

For example: 
Whenever I think something bad about myself I try to think of something else but I just end up having like a panic attack and not being able to control my thoughts, it’s like I’m driving myself crazy. 

I’m so tired of living like this and if any of you have felt like this please comment I really can’t take it anymore.

,depression,"TL;DR: Lost lots of weight from gym, doing better socially, doing better in college and going to therapy and taking antidepressants. All of this and still depressed and want to die but can't because people would be sad.

I have worked on myself physically losing a lot of weight and going to the gym and doing a lot more walking. I've been putting more effort into college to feel a sense of accomplishment. I have dedicated a good bit of time to hang out with friends and do spontaneous outings to try and enjoy life. Then lastly therapy and antidepressants is something I have been doing for a good bit of time now, therapy 6 months and antidepressants for at least a month now.

So everything that should fix my feelings of depression and being done and yet I still don't care for living much.

,depression,"i was hungover when i left my place around 2pm to go to the doctors'.

the cold air was refreshing and i felt pretty calm coz my nerves were too f\*\*\*ed to give a s\*\*t.

(after my appointment)

.... turning the corner, on the way out of the building, with my head down slightly, i noticed 2 nasty f\*\*\*ers on their way in.

i never looked up at them, i didn't have to, i just recognised their clothes &amp; the way they carried themselves.

(these kinds of people are why i rarely leave the house)

i continued to look down, hoping like hell that they wouldn't notice me.

i turned my body slightly to create more room for them to get past me.

now that i think about it, everything about me is screaming subservience.

not much i can do about that. these guys scare me. 

everything i do will be an act of fear.

i just want to get back home.

leave me alone.

&amp;#x200B;

i had just lost sight of them out of the corner of my eye when one of them barked...

""Hey how you doin man?! You remember me?!""

these kinds of guys knock the wind out of me as soon as i see them...

their grating, aggressive tones don't do my solar plexus any good...

(or my intestines for that matter) 

... he asked if i remembered him. (i had never seen him in my life)

i took a long, squinted look at him, with a kind of 

puzzled smile on my face... looking like i was gonna say something...

finally, i shook my head &amp; laughed a little...

a nervous laugh... (but not overly nervous because the hangover made me feel a little more relaxed than i would have been normally)

&amp;#x200B;

""sorry man i think you've got me confused with someone else""

&amp;#x200B;

""nah! i used to go out with your ex girlfriend!""

&amp;#x200B;

i'm laughing inside, no way in hell would my ex go near this guy.

that's the honest &amp; correct answer but of course i was never gonna say that...

even though it was the dominant thought in my head and those can sometimes just slip out or people can just instantly pick up on them... and maybe he did...

he didn't like me either way...

i mean he must've really thought he knew me &amp; was just tryin' to rub this s\*\*t in about him f\*\*\*\*ing my ex...

OR he was making it up because he didn't like the look of me &amp; thought he would just \*\*\*\* with me...

&amp;#x200B;

he looks like a 35yr old junkie

&amp;#x200B;

but he's not accepting that he's got me confused with someone else....

for whatever reason....

&amp;#x200B;

""she's got blonde hair right?""

&amp;#x200B;

""my ex gf has blonde hair yeah""

&amp;#x200B;

(that really narrows it down huh?)

&amp;#x200B;

""I USED TO GO OUT WITH HER!""

&amp;#x200B;

i instantly dismiss the the notion multiple times in quick succession.

i'm practically saying ""this is just not possible... we're not in the same league""

(in hindsight i realise that my dismissal was so obvious that i was lucky he didn't pick up on it as an insult &amp; f\*\*k me up)

his friend, who hasn't said anything &amp; doesn't seem particularly threatening says somewhat quietly &amp; passively

""what's her name?""

i wasn't sure who he was directing it at.

wether he was curious about this himself or was bored &amp; just trying to move it along.

&amp;#x200B;

i think ""yeah! good point!""

&amp;#x200B;

""what's her name?"" i ask the 1st guy, still smiling out of confusion &amp; nervousness, doing my best to look light-hearted &amp; unafraid

&amp;#x200B;

""no YOU tell me her name"" he says

&amp;#x200B;

at this point it's occured to me that maybe he's seen me &amp; my ex around in the past &amp; he didn't, or doesn't, like the looks of me... maybe he's just fishing for information that he can use to mess with me.

(of course, he could've genuinely been mistaking me for someone else)

i wasn't about to give this nasty lookin m\*\*\*\*\*f\*\*\*er ANY information about me.

i just kinda laughed &amp; looked confused...

i've no idea what he's talking about

&amp;#x200B;

i think ""\*\*\*\* it... i'll try &amp; figure out where this guy is coming from""

i repeat that i'm sure he's mixed me up with someone else &amp; pull my hat back a little to let him see me a bit more clearly

he still didn't seem to accept it but we both just turned away anyway...

I have plenty of mental disorders,

I was firstly diagnosed after I dropped out of school last year 2022

and during that time before when I was attending school

at that period of time I had a couple of friends I hanged out with 

around 5 friends

I'm really close to the one of the girls and my boy bestfriend,

Due to some personal problems he moved towns and since then our 

contact has been less through social media.

we were close till then(we were best friends for 5 years) and I dropped out at that time

and was admitted for more than a month as I had some medical conditions to deal with,

and then the mental disorders too, I told her that for the time being we would contact rarely

as I really need some space (I was bullied for a while, my friend had no idea as I used to be alone

and not tell her about it) bs happened and she found out about it from my parents as her parents 

contacted each other after all these shit happened.

I feel like I hurt her and she must have felt lonely at the time as I didn't keep in contact for several 

months.

the problem here is when I was her friend during 2021-2022 I said stuff that would trigger people who 

were like suffering from depression/self harm/suicidal thoughts and like that.

I would say stuff like suicidal things as a joke, which I shouldn't have done.

I also made myself down by saying I'm not a good friend and blocking her contacts during the time I 

needed space, which I regret doing.

I feel like a triggering person And I feel like my mental health is the reason why 

My other friends also keep a distance from me.

She still talks to me everyday I apologized to her like last year december,

she was struggling with depression &amp; suicidal thoughts  (she wasn't comfortable opening about it)

usually joked about death and stuff Altho her social media is filled with 

depressing &amp; stuff like that.

I know I'm only a liability at this point. 

But reality is, I'm totally destroyed, depressed, has anxiety, or whatever disorders I have in the list of mental illnesses. I have severe anxiety issues on even the thought of having a job, because I never trained myself to be proficient at speaking things out loud, nor I have the confidence enough to even apply. Additionally, I never had any experience working at anything at all, so it's harder to even find a job where every description has 50 years of experience when you're at 20 years of age. All of my friends are away and surely can't provide assistance if I can't even help myself.

These few days I would just pretend it's a normal day, dress up and leave for work and go to a coffee shop far away where I think no one would know me, and spend the whole day there browsing and applying to job posts.

Few times my parents offered to drive me to work and I got panicked, made up a fake company and location and then to go nearby coffeeshop and hope no one recognizes me

,depression,"Wow this is the first time I have ever said this out loud. I’ve had a pretty tough childhood, it was crappy to say the least. I had to watch and listen to my dad physically and verbally abuse my mom. That was until they got a divorce. After that I had to listen to each one of them talk badly about the other one which made my nine-year-old brain pretty confused. You know how when you’re a kid and you think your parents are perfect. Well I guess I didn’t have that problem.

One time I wasn’t even allowed to tell my dad where we were going on holiday in case he might follow us there. My mom’s a bit paranoid I guess, because I don’t think that would have been something that he would do.
But just imagine not being able to talk honestly to the person that’s supposed to be closest to you.

My dad passed away when I was 16. Just like that, just suddenly. I didn’t even get a chance to say goodbye to him. I didn’t have the best relationship with him because it was so messed up with all of the talking badly and divorce stuff, so we never really had a normal relationship and I remember that him telling me that I would feel sorry about that. I now do, but there’s nothing I can do.

After the divorce, my mom went on to have multiple boyfriends, each one worse than the other. It’s like the woman has a type. Some spend some of her money, some were just dumb (like even a kid could see that they were stupid), some were old, like grandpa‘s age (which now that I think about it it’s sickening). One of those boyfriends was a TEACHER in my school and of course I said that I wasn’t comfortable with her dating him, I was a child. And he was hated in my school, kids didn’t really like him and they didn’t exactly love me either because I was a bit nerdy, so I just didn’t need that on my back as well.

She now goes on to say that I’ve ruined it for her and that I ruined her life, that I’ve never supported her in anything, which still haunts me honestly.

I’ve developed a panic attack disorder after my dad passed away and I also have a major binge eating disorder, which I use to cope with everything and find a sense of relief.

She’s a smoker and I’m scared for her and I told her that multiple times. My dad was a smoker too. And I don’t mean the types to just light a cigarette here and there, I’m talking like 20 a day.

Her new boyfriend smokes a lot too, so whenever I mention it to her, she started yelling at me and she acts like a straight up addict. Then starts to shame me for example for eating pasta a lot because that’s my favorite food, and I honestly use it just as a relief from everyday. But she doesn’t know I suffer from binging so she’s just making it worse by saying those things.

She’s back with her ex who doesn’t have a job. He just does handyman stuff here and there. And so of course I’m worried about him using her, but she doesn’t even wanna hear me out and starts yelling and hurting my feelings.

I feel so broken and I wake up in the night with pain in my teeth because I clench them so much, that I even managed to destroy the enamel on them.

So as I’ve said, I’ve imagined a different reality in which I have both loving parents and a normal household. I have envisioned how my home looks like and how my friends treat me (which I only have two of those, so I guess I won in that field of life as well).",t2_5ytiz2df,False,,0,False,I have imagined an alternate reality for myself because I just can’t live in this one anymore,[],r/depression,False,,,0,,False,t3_12pgllt,False,dark,1.0,,public,9,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,9,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1681739284.0,text,,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow this is the first time I have ever said this out loud.

,depression,"I mean, I always have the impression that all the people who interact with me, from my ""friends"" to my mother, are ready to stop the interaction as soon as I talk about me being deeply sad. 

That's right, I don't even have to use the word ""depressed""; just the hint of me not feeling ok, without any detailed explanation of how actually f*ed up I feel, is enough to let them step away from the discussion. It's like they don't care, and that's ok actually. I am not saying they should. 

What bothers me is just the feeling of not being taken seriously, even though maybe I just would like to talk. It's like telling someone something really important, a big part of you, and hearing them belittle you on this. Such a disrespect, but I don't know, maybe I'm just expecting too much from the same people who are expected to take me seriously, like my mother or my friends... you know, people close to me, in theory at least... they just don't, and nobody does; when it comes to opening up on feeling really bad everyone just turns away. I feel offended actually. 

But then I wonder:""ok so what should they do? Just listen to my lamentations about me feeling dead inside, about how I hate life? And then what? What are they supposed to do, or even just say?"" 
What if they listened and answered with care? Would it really change anything? 

Damn I feel so lonely. These people really like me, but only a part of me, the part that smiles and talks about the boring bullshit of normal lives, but they don't realize that it's just my surface. Anytime I try, desperate, to grab them and let them see that there's something more in me which is horrible, they are out fast. Maybe I am desperate because I feel the urge to open up, but the whole world runs away as soon as I open my mouth. But again: why open up? What's the point? 

I realized that around time I started do the same; I'm becoming more and more incapable of taking anyone seriously, for any reason that is not about a serious pain. It seems that I can only consider pain as something real in life. 
I mean, if nobody takes me seriously, why shall I take the others seriously? People are not even sentient beings anymore to my eyes, they are just walking jokes.

Yeah, is f*ed up, this is bad and I feel like I should isolate myself more and more, but I know that would kill me inside. I don't know what to do. Even right now, here, I'm just opening up, and the screen does not run away while I'm doing it, and I know behind the screen there are people in the same or even worse condition, so they know that these horrific things that we feel are really serious.

,depression,"Well.

I don't even know where to start.

I'm about to lose my job, I lost 2 people who meant alot to me (one was family and happened yesterday), 2 people I cared about alot turned their backs, I'm running out of money constantly without anything else left than smoke and a hard working liver.

I want to stop. But I can't. I can't give my family another death, especially not ""exit the game of life"".

But it's like an unbearable burden to stay alive when everything is falling apart... Again.

Some want me to get professional help, but they don't understand that they are an authority figure and I have to tell a lie. Idk why, I just have to, even if it's only a ""good"" to the question how I am.

I'm burned out. 
I'm in the middle of my 20s and feel like I'm old. Very old.
Not even drugs help anymore, and I don't want to take medicine to feel something.
But all I feel is grief, disgust at myself and sorrow.
There's no way out, but all I can do is wait.

Thinking alot about stuff i ""shouldn't do"", and I'm too afraid to talk to anyone about them because I don't want anyone to worry about me. Or worse get me into one of those facilities where men with white clothes telling you everything will be alright while giving you a cocktail of drugs to shut yourself off.

But life gets harder, and like Nomy say in ""Shoreline"" ""It's hard to life when you're getting older, but it's easier to die when you're young.""
If I only knew how right they were.

,depression,"I  had a gf for like a month, nothing serious, she broke up with me (this  was a year ago) and I got pretty sad. After I got over her I fell in  love ith my best friend's gf. Got pretty depressed. I told him I was  depressed and he was very supportive - hugging me, talking to me, asking  me how I'm doing, caring, etc. I read online you should spend more time  with friends so I invited him over and had lots of fun so I did that a  couple more times. I even told him about my feelings to his gf and he  was very understanding. (Now my feeling to her had weakened drastically)

Suddenly  I was happy! I knew I had someone who cared, I was not alone. Whenever I  was sad I recalled something that we did that had made me happy, and  just thought about how I like having him as my friend.

Some  time later turns out he told her, which got me upset but I forgave him.  We just had a 3 week holiday, and we're soon finishing school. and as I  feared would happen we met less and less and he barely had time for me -  yet he had made lots of time for her - which upsets me. I'm not mad - I  understand she matters to him more than I do, which is ok but it just  frustrates me. We had argued the last few days (each day something  different), and yesterday I was rude when we did, and today he barely  spoke to me at school. He says he's not mad, but I don't know what to  think (he had claimed a few months ago to stop lying - in general - to  everybody) so I believe that, but I'm worried that he might be fazing me  out or something. He had mentioned a few months ago that he is thinking  about completely leaving everything in his life (including me and the  gf) which terrified me at the time, and ever more so now.

I guess i have two questions:

1. What should I do?
2. I  don't wanna depend on him for happiness, should I try to be happy,  recalling fun we had etc, or should I be sad for some time tying to  learn being alone? I really hate how I'm feeling but I don't wanna  depend on him for being happy... I feel shit rn, and have for like a two  weeks, and I think that recalling fun we had and stuff would help but I  don't wanna depend on that...

I’m about at dumb as a box of rocks. My driving anxiety is so bad that even with having my license (not sure how I passed) I almost break down when driving, so it would be impossible to make friends or date someone who lives more than 20 mins away. I’m trying, I really am, but it feels useless. 

Whenever I’m with my sister I just become so jealous. She’s perfect at everything I’m bad at. I’m the older sister, yet she’s more of an adult than me. 

And everyone thinks I’m doing ok because I smile and laugh. It’s just like how when I’m sick I still eat. I’m depressed but I still laugh and smile. I regret every single word I say. I’ve cried so much to my mom and grandma that now I’m just an annoying burden. I have to cry alone by myself and hope/wait for the sadness to eventually pass.

I had friends, healthy family relationships, no anxiety or depression. I had a life. I had more of a life at 6 than I do at 19. I have no friends, not even one. I’m average looking and have no prospects of dating because I just can’t imagine someone putting up with me; I feel like I’m not a good enough person for someone to date. I’m about at dumb as a box of rocks. My driving anxiety is so bad that even with having my license (not sure how I passed) I almost break down when driving, so it would be impossible to make friends or date someone who lives more than 20 mins away. I’m trying, I really am, but it feels useless. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever I’m with my sister I just become so jealous. She’s perfect at everything I’m bad at. I’m the older sister, yet she’s more of an adult than me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And everyone thinks I’m doing ok because I smile and laugh. It’s just like how when I’m sick I still eat. I’m depressed but I still laugh and smile. I regret every single word I say. I’ve cried so much to my mom and grandma that now I’m just an annoying burden. I have to cry alone by myself and hope/wait for the sadness to eventually pass. And few months back I began to self harm again, but I kept it to myself, but this time the scars are deeper and when I go swimming I don’t know how I’ll hide them, but I’ll figure it out. I always do. The only way out is through, I repeat that to myself a lot and it kinda helps.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"
I plan on asking after my birthday. (Which is in two days) I’ll be turning 17. They should be finding out tomorrow that I cut myself. Whether it be from me or my therapist. I’m struggling. I don’t think I can live in society the way I am now. There’s so much to explain. My profile is full of details so just stalk there if you’re curious. 

Therapy has never been much help to me. Medication is okay but no one listens to me and everyone wants to take me off of it. I’ve been in therapy for 6 years and have gotten incredibly worse. 

I can’t get a job, I can’t go to the store, I can’t even be alone with myself or there will be intrusive thoughts. Even my dreams have been compromised. Full of death and abuse. 

I forgot how to feel. How to retain memories. How to focus. How to think for myself. I feel so trapped and so empty. My body is covered in cuts right now. But god it will never be enough. I can’t show how much pain I am from the outside. It’s not enough proof. It’s so much worse in my head than my measly scars. 

I’m not scared of myself. Maybe that’s part of the problem. I can do things without emotion. Sure, the pain is horrid but for some reason it doesn’t matter to me. I used to be scared of myself before my emotions started to go away. I used to be scared of what I’d do if I didn’t get help but now I stopped caring. I want to be able to care again. About myself and others.

,depression,"I'm going to explain my situation in the best detail I can right now and why I think im going to give up.

So I'm 26 living in a shithole, I have feelings for a friend who has feelings for me also but because I live with my ex we decidedly not to pursue a relationship or dating because I don't have a job and because my ex still has feelings for me and has threatened to kick me out of her house if I did get in a relationship or started dating and with no where else I can go if she did would mean I'd end up homeless.

There are jobs where I live but iv been so depressed and anxious the past 2 years iv been placed on unfit for work because of my mental health I constantly overthink things and iv never worked before and I'm scared I will fail. 

I don't go out much unless I'm with a friend or I need something from the shop I can't stand being around people anymore the fact I have to put on a fake smile and pretend like everything is OK when secretly I'm miserable and wish I wasn't borne or that someone would just do me a favour and kill me.

My only friends are online I have 1 person irl other then my housemate ex and my mother who I talk to about stuff happened in my life who listens to me he's a great person who's going through his own depression and we have always tried to help eachother.

I should explain that after I was kicked out of my mother's house my ex gave me a place to stay and I barly get any free time to myself she's constantly around me, or online with me even tho I don't mind spending time with her I feel so anxious to ask for some space just to have time for myself as she gets upset.

Me and my ex never use to get into any heavy arguments we use to have a laugh and play games together however when I wanted to expand my friend group she got bitter towards me that I'd spend time with them even tho I'd spend almost the entire day with her then once she started hanging out with us as I thought if they became her friends too then it would fix the problem however when a new guy joined me and him started chatting and we really chatted about eachother out likes dislikes and such and he said he liked me after a few weeks we would chat constantly and he even started traveling to hang out with me and my ex then later we even started to flirt and then he asked me out but I was unsure how to respond because I lived with my ex so we had the idea while we were all hanging out irl he'd ask her how she would feel if he was to ask me out and that's were shit hit the fan she because so upset and aimed it all at me saying shit that honestly made me feel like I did actually do something horrible even tho I hadn't 

It's almost been a year since the guy asked me out we decided to stay friends because if me and my ex did fall out he didn't want it to be his fault and me to be dependent on him which I understand tho recently even tho we decided to stay friends he's started flirting again and while hanging out he kissed my neck nothing wierd he'd done it before and such but not realising he had left a mark on my neck and my ex has ripped into me thinking me and him are a thing.

 And I'm going to be honest with everything else in my life going to shit with my mental health benefits possibly ending, cost of living going up, all the war talk, covid, my anxiety and depression getting worse, and the face I have pretty much no social life outside of 4-6 people the only thought iv had an house before writing this even now all I want to do is something stupid I have a thought in the back of my head saying ""kill yourself, cut, choke yourself"" and I just want to cry because I'm too much of a coward to fucking do it...",t2_vgee9dkf,False,,0,False,I think im getting close to giving up...,[],r/depression,False,,,0,,False,t3_12py8ev,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1681768118.0,text,,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m going to explain my situation in the best detail I can right now and why I think im going to give up.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm always going to the doctors trying to discover if i have diseases...

I have issue with my brain I start to create syntoms and believe that I have a lot of diseases, I can't sleep I can't work very well it's horrible...

Well I was feeling lonely some time ago and I start friendship with a 20 yo girl by internet... I'm latino and she is Slavic, we have been talking for 7 months... And well both fell in love for each other, I asked her if I could visit her but i said can we share the expenses cuz would be very very very expensive for me... But she refuses... We tried almost 10 times (Or more I don't remember) block each other and stop talking but we can't... I can't stop thinking about her we take the same antidepressant everyday we have the same problem ''generalized anxiety disorder'' .

I have the money to visit her but I don't have the enough money to spend in hotel... I think I failed cuz I can't pay, I can't get away from her, I can't bet my anxious about imaginary diseases that ''I have'', I'm smoking weed mixing with antidepressant cuz i want stay high to don't remember about her and about the diseases that I have studied... (Yes I start read about many diseases and I think I have it).

I had another love experiences in the past but I don't fucking know I found myself on her, but she doesn't understand my money problems... Sometimes I just wanna disapear of this world it's too much trouble I hope she doesn't read it, but today I was sitting in the window of my built thinking in end with my life... It's too much suffering I start to feel imaginary diseases and think about her with another man... It's painful as fuck... But I didn't hrow myself out the window because I was afraid to never listen her ''I love you''...

I'm only children I love my mom and my dad but they don't understand about my love issues... with this girl... I know sounds ridiculous but when I'm crises about my healthy I start feel malaise, urge to vomit, stomach ache,eye pain, lack of appetite and my blood pressure drops...

My sanity it's not good I pray everyday for God help me but I see my ''friend'' in my daily...

Yesterday I have a call with my best friend and... well I feel so good... mixed of emotions hapiness, peace and tranquility... no antidepressant made me feel this way. She is always in my head...

I told to my local friend if I do something wrong send my letters to her I have a lot for my friends, my family to they don't feel guilthy, it's just about my brain and my crises of hypochondria, my friend said ''Bro I can pay you a hot whore just to you forgot this girl'' and I refused because well I'm catholic and I think this is totally wrong finance people in this deplorable state of life and I love that woman...

I was a good boy for my mom, dad , grandma and grandpa... Now i'm a shame i'm smoking weed, totally tired always in the bed trying to get better everyday but it's really hard... I work from home so it makes me so depressive, my room it's my ownprison like my mind...

My pass time it's play but i don't feel good with it anymore sometimes when I try to draw involuntarily i start to draw me and that woman...

All my situation isnt new and i feel that most ppl can relate to some part of this but i just can't do this anymore.
I can't keep with these changes of emotions that i have.

And the very next day i can feel like if nothing happened and go on until im back at my sad phase again.

And if only i had anyone to tell...

And since my grades (which used to be top) are starting to go down (i have failed some subjects), in my latest year at collage, I'm feeling useless. I'm unable to study anymore, i sit and waste hours looking at nothing.

It's a loop and im starting to get tired of this, of myself.

,depression,"The autumn and winter of 2022 were a living hell for me. I still wonder how I managed to survive bc I was literally omw to die. 

However, I am here. And I got better somehow and got interested in tarot and all this esoteric stuff.

Found out that I can't even die because I was never really born. My soul has always been there and will always be. If I commit suicide, only my physical frame will die, not my soul. So the whole idea of death became so pointless to me. 

But it doesn't make it better, really. Now I'm like ""Ok, I just have to endure this suffering till the next reincarnation"". I'm also afraid that the very fact of taking my own life away will only make the next reincarnation even worse. And I don't want it. 

But still..we, people, can't know the truth. So I only can assume that what I've said is real. 

From the one hand, this realization made my depression slightly easier to bear bc I'm like ""Hey, your sufferings don't matter  anyway"", but.
From the other hand, death has always been my last chance to achieve peace or at least disappear from this fucked up world. Death was my last refuge. Now that I know that death won't release me from this world(because I have always been here in this world and will always be), it(death) has lost its worth for me. 

And I feel like I'm trapped in a cage named ""The world"". I can't disappear because there's no place to hide. I'm always here. 

I feel trapped. At the same time, I feel free. But depression doesn't go away anyway.

&lt;p&gt;But at the moment I am feeling a pain that comes from the psychological. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a discomfort in my chest that won&amp;#39;t go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s hard to describe but the feeling is like I have a hole in my chest. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yeah thanks for reading I had no one to tell that to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a great day. :)&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hi all,

I’ve spent a decent amount of time scrolling through this sub and reading people’s situations. So many feel dejected, lost, and spent. Nothing left to give, but the world just keeps asking and asking. How the hell are we expected to move on when every exertion of effort feels excruciating in the face of endless adversity? How do you continue when it feels so easy to just bend and break?

All these things compound, and yet, so many of us continue on. Is that living? Maybe a bit cliché, I know, but what does it mean to live? I’ve thought about it a lot, but I realize that this question is pretty subjective. With that being said, what does it mean to live to you?

For me, and most others I figure, it’s a combination of things. I live for those that still find a way to believe in me. For those that have tragically lost their battle with themselves and aren’t here to fight anymore. But, I also live for the hope, however disillusioned it might be, that someday I’ll become a person at peace with the world. Are all these reasons enough to keep me here? Sure, for now. Of course there are days where my clarity is near-zero and all the things I mentioned fall apart, but other days it’s enough for me.

That being said, living for yourself is maybe the most important part. Not that I always do it, I realize it’s a very critical part of living that can be easy to lose sight of.

Therapy, meds, exercise, diet, school, going out, I’m fucking hopeless. These are supposed to be the best years of my life LMFAO these are the fucking worst. Therapy and medication since i was fucking 14, before that I was so anxious I couldn’t speak I would hide and people would ask my mom if there was something wrong with me. Fucking 8 years of doctors and meds at least it helped a bit with anxiety. Ive always been a fucking freak and I’m so sick and tired. Wow like life really isn’t fair. Like no matter what life fucks you man. I envy people who don’t have mental illness. I hate being the fucking happy polite person everyone tells me and my parents how good and nice of a person I am BUT IM FUCKING TIRED WHEN WILL SOMEONE TREAT ME LIKE THAT god god god like I don’t even know what to do. I hate being there for my friends and no one is there for me. Lmfao well “friends” is not even the right word I have no one. Literally sit alone all day and don’t speak one word until my mom comes home from work and even then it’s not much. How can there be nothing explicitly horrible in my life but I feel so hopeless and awful. Like im not poor on the streets and im not physically abused so I shouldn’t feel like this. BUT I DO I FEEL HORRIBLE AND IT MAKES ME SO MAD. My therapy tells me I have a lot of trauma, yeah no kidding. Being an only child, I don’t even have siblings to talk to I have my dog and honestly without her I would ffucking lose it. My mom used to be my best friend but my declining mental health has ruined this relationship. I get mad at her and say things I shouldn’t and she gets mad at me and just doesn’t understand. I feel so alone and she’s not even there for me anymore she tells me how rude I am, and how horrible I am, and is so mean to me and tells me it’s because of the way I treat her I always have to apologize to her and she never apologizes back I feel even more alone now. My mental health ruins all my relationships probably of course it’s me tho god. I wish I was straight all these girls are so mean and I’m so touch starved. Why do people think it’s funny to play jokes on dating apps do people not have anything better to do.

I hope one day it gets better bc it’s not fair how poor innocent children, and people who are happy, die randomly like to things out of their control. I want to be happy and live a good life maybe one day god I try as hard as I can with my fucked up head. There was no hope for me. My whole family has mental illness. My grandfather killed himself, and my parents are fucked. they try their best they really do but I think it’s hopeless. I sit here like a ball of anxiety heart racing for no reason other then thinking of my life and how sad I am. I hate this because I always think of how much worse other people have it.

,depression,"I thought nothing would happen after my brother threatened my dad, but a lot has happened, first off after that whole confrontation, my dad started treating him like he was 9 years old even though he is 18. He took away his privileges of seeing his friends, he wasn't able to go out, he made my brother cosign his bank account to my dad so he could keep tabs on what he was spending (note he never did drugs or alcohol), he forced him to download life360 so he could track his location to make sure he didn't do anything stupid or would be wandering off so he could basically always keep tabs on my older brother, at first he showed almost no remorse and interest in what was happening, he had this i don't care attitude, this has been going on since February and has been going on ever since, He isn't even able to drive anymore, my dad took away his license and all forms of ID until he would quote on quote ""I'll give you all your privileges back once I start seeing some change from you because apparently, telling you the same thing over and over doesn't work for you so I'm going to try a different approach"" The only problem with my brother was that he had a lot of problems throughout college, he was always exhausted because my dad wanted him to get all A's even in some hard classes like Intro to Global Business and Accounting, the other thing was that, he would always get mad at him for every simple thing like not going to church on time, not coming home before 10 PM, doing assignments at the last minute, not going to the gym regularly (he was like fat but not super fat, like skinny, fat: 230 lbs. 6'1). these are the things that made him lose his privileges originally, the threatening thing made it worse. My dad didn't even bother sending my brother to a psychiatrist or counseling or anything like that, he said that it was a waste of money and that this was the exact same thing his dad did to him (the whole parenting thing, losing privileges and nitpicking on an 18-year-old and treating him like 9). I couldn't believe what my dad was saying, I noticed that my brothers' condition kept on getting worse, (Note: my parents are divorced) so whenever we'd go to my mom's house for the weekend, he would always put up a straight face and act as if nothing was happening in the other house like business is normal and casual. In my brother's life as a high school student, I know that he indeed did not have a good high school experience, he always got good grades and had friends, but fights were common in his school, he had a couple of bullies too that he beat the hell out of, one of those bullies used to call my brother a nickname that he absolutely hated and despised and would always get furious whenever someone called him that specific name. One day, my dad was getting annoyed because it was spring break and my brother was sleeping through the day till like 3PM because he was exhausted, and my dad turned on all of the lights, opened the blinds, and then splashed water on his face to wake him up, when he finally got up 30 minutes later, he got an earful from my dad saying that it was a beautiful day and that he should go to the gym because it wasn't good to be fat and lazy and he just ignored that comment, and then my dad inadvertently called him the same nickname that the bullies at school called him which angered him and then he punched my dad in the face and gave him a death like stare and told him to never call him that again and then he walked down and pretended nothing happened. my dad was shocked obviously and he apparently, he thought it was like a form of my brother rebelling against his methods of controlling his life. So, he ultimately became stricter with my brother, he became more ridiculous as a parent, he was ultimately trying to give my brother hell and trying to make him apologize for that little punch to the face, whenever he went to church now, my dad would try and embarrass him Infront of his friends and then he would tell my brother's bad habits to his friend's dads and kept telling them to make sure to keep track of their own children and make sure they didn't end up picking up the same habits. My dad had no right to go tell other people how to parent their children. My brother got incredibly mad at my dad, so he moved out and went to my mom's for a couple of weeks because of the way he was being treated by my dad.

Haven't talked to mum for a week because she said my behaviour was strange. Apparently I don't interact with people. I know how to and I have a lot of times. She thinks that way because of some these reasons.

\- Had some guests over for dinner but I stayed to study for a Physics test for the entire night, which i had in the next few days. Next morning my Mother scolded me for not talking to them enough.

\- Went to sleep early (11pm) as soon as guests came over. I was really tired then and my parents even knew it. But the next morning my Mother scolded me for 'sleeping as soon as they came over' and i was avoiding 'social interaction'

\- I look pissed all the time, and i dont smile. I don't even know how to comment on this one, I am happy at most times of the day, my resting face just looks pissed lol i am not actually pissed.

One day she came up to me and asked if I was depressed and stuff ( i obviously wasn't but hurt that she thought of me as an antisocial loser, who doesn't talk to people), she even asked if i needed professional help. I ignored her because it was so annoying to assume that. My crucial mistake was that I didn't explain myself properly, on why I didn't interact with guests (tests + i was tired) and my resting face. I was just so pissed I didn't say a word. Ever since then she hadn't talked to me and it's been a week.

I may be shy and a bit stubborn on not talking, but I am not entirely antisocial lmao. I have proven to my parents that I can talk to people appropriately in social atmospheres but they keep forgetting. When I went on a trip to visiting relatives a few months ago, she complained to me that I didn't talk enough to my relatives, and that they were concerned about me. What the hell am i supposed to talk to people I rarely meet and talk to?? One thing about me is that I am nervous talking to others in front of my parents... I will literally be the most confident person on the earth if my parents were not present btw. My mother thinks my behaviour is bad.

She was comparing me to my friends, and thinks im the worst of them all now. Just recently I overheard my parents talk about some other kids they met and said they were really smart and polite. My mum said that she wished that she had kids like that. (im an only child).  I didn't say a word and just washed the dishes. 

I honestly felt so depressed after that, my mother not talking to me is not my fault. She had false thoughts about me but i didn't correct her in time. I was too lazy but it's not my fault at all. 

I don't even look her in the eye anymore, I haven't spoke a word to her in ages.

,depression,Because of my shitty parents. My mother abandoned me at age like 8 and my father emotionally abused the fuck out of me my entire teenagehood after our family fell apart. He took all his bitterness out on me. Only child. Ex best friend was like my sister and in the end she physically attacked me over a petty fight and things were never the same. I never had a mother. I never had a real good friend in my life. I ended up in the ICU after a suicide attempt and only my father was there for me. 30 years alive on this planet and only my father would've come to my funeral if I had died. WhTs the point anymore?

,depression,"This is more of a vent post because I truly am starting to feel like I have no one I can communicate with. There has been so much going on for me in life and I truly feel like I'll burn out before I can even graduate with my degree. I'm fighting every day to go back to classes every week because the desire to drop out keeps getting stronger and stronger. When I first started school, I never struggled this much. I felt like I had support and I was doing okay on my own. Then I got into a relationship with someone who has a terminal disease. Problem is, they use their disease to get out of doing what is needed to keep both of us supported. And I know it sounds bad when I say it, but it has been admitted that they use their disease as a gateway out of anything they want, whenever they want. So now I struggle to be supportive when there could be chances where they are actually sick and I feel so terrible for thinking that way. But these issues have gotten us closer and closer to losing our house, it's turned into where I have been gaslit anytime I bring something that revolves around the situation. I love them to death and would do anything for them, but I keep thinking more and more that nothing I worry about, or even times when I am happy, means a thing. 

The last time we had a huge argument, I had a panic attack so bad I needed to talk to my mom and it turned into a situation where our wedding was a stake. And now I can't talk to anyone anytime that I get upset because I'm going to make them look like they're abusing me or people are going to hate them. I don't want to do that, but at the same time, I need someone to be able to help me when I'm struggling. Now I don't feel as if I can anymore. I'm slowly accepting that I'm forced to suffer in silence because of how much I've had to in the previous years. Whenever I would stress it would be ""no big deal"" or I would be told, ""There's no reason to stress."" All I ever wanted for someone to do was acknowledge that they saw I was hurting. I now struggle so much with severe depression and anxiety because of everything...

Now I fear talking to the part of my family I love the most in the world (my mother's side) or talking to even my closest friends (which is VERY few). Throughout the years of my relationship, more of my friendships have taken a tumble and have crashed so hard that I lost someone who was supposed to be in my wedding. We've recently gotten back in touch, but there is still some awkwardness whenever I bring up my significant other because part of our tumble involved them. I have so much I could vent about but no matter what I feel as if I need to filter everything I say.

I’ve lost two extremely important people to me, both passed quickly. One was a young person who was my best friend and honestly has shook my life apart. I’ve not gone one day without feeling sad or crying. 

I moved abroad to get away from my life back home, to live for me and my partner of 8 years. We needed this we didn’t just want it we needed this to work. 

I have moved, gotten a job I love (easy and temporary) and renting an apartment with my partner and a great room mate. I even have one of my best friends living over the road. So why am I so miserable all the time? 

I’ve never ever been without financial struggle as I’ve never not lived pay check to pay check. I am only 27 and I know I’m so lucky and really should not be complaining as so many people have such a hard time. But I feel exhausted, I feel like my life is going to be nothing but misery, when all I ever did was try and give myself a better life than I had. I feel like I cannot work or grow for myself because I’m so exhausted from all this pain and hurt. I want to be good to my future self, I want to prepare my life for maybe children one day. 

At this moment, I almost feel like giving up on everything, life the whole lot just done. I’m not sure this life is for me anymore or if I even want to experience what’s to come. 

I don’t want to talk to my partner about this because he has been so good to me and helped me so much that he too also lost his best friend and he needs his own time to grieve and heal from the loss. 

I’ve decided to not speak to my friends about it anymore because I can’t deal with it anymore why should they? And my family will not hear me complain ever again. 

They have all been so good to me but I was to be happy. I want to have fun and I want to be the old me. I’m so lost and hurt and full of so much pain. 

Is there any advice words or wisdom I dunno anything? I’m looking for anything small to help me get through this. It’s feeling impossible.

I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression at age 12 and I feel like every year since then I’ve experienced a new low. I am currently experiencing the worst depression I’ve ever had in my life. I’m lonely. So very lonely that I fear that I’m becoming resentful of the happy couples in my life, whether that be in my friend groups or family or even strangers. Every night I hope that I will feel better In the morning, only to wake up and realize that the dream that I dreamt was all fiction and I have to come back to the haunting reality that is being myself. 
I feel that the worst part is, I’m not in any rock bottom position realistically. I have a home I can go to, a job that I’m perfectly content on working at, and supportive friends. 
But even then I feel like these friends that have shown me nothing but support, don’t give a shit about me, and I don’t know why. I feel so angry all the time now, and never for any reason then I’m frustrated in so many ways, and I’d rather just lay in bed all day and live in my head even if it makes it worse.

,depression,"I've been in a depressive state for at least three weeks now. I haven't gone grocery shopping. I checked the mail once to get my paycheck because bills were due. I've showered only on the few days I had to leave the house. Dishes are piled up in the sink, on the counters on the floor next to my computer. It probably smells horrible, but I can't tell. 

I work from home and I don't complete my work, that will catch up with me very soon. I barely wake up for work, and certainly not on time. 

I get cravings to feel something good again and I'll watch porn. I'll jerk off to porn for hours at a time, like 5+ sometimes. It feels good and I lose connection with the world. Then I'm more numb than I was before. But that kind of feels good in a way, being numb isn't feeling sad right? But being numb hurts the people around me because I can't care about anything including them. Then I get sad about being numb, and that hurts. So I make myself feel better, and I get more numb. 

I hurt my girlfriend. Not intentionally or physically but I still did. It's hard to communicate when you're zoned out for hours at a time. I neglected her, it took me hours and hours to get back to her, I missed plans with her because of this. Just left her hanging like she was no one to me. The moments of clarity I get sprinkled throughout are just perfect too. Then I can realize what a shitty thing I did to someone I care about. Someone who's told me they've experienced intentional emotional abuse from an ex in the form of neglect. It's something I should never have put her through unintentional or not.  

I start to realize that I'm numb to her too. I don't feel anything for her and it happened out of nowhere. We were having an amazing week together just the week before. I know I care about her, because I remember caring, but I don't feel it. 

 I'm in the avoident attachment style camp, normally that's okay and I can put aside my discomfort and not withdraw. But when I don't feel that anything matters, including her, and I have no drive or will or energy it's impossible not to withdraw. 

I just kept getting more and more distant. Some moments were good and I felt like myself with her, but most of the time I couldn't communicate effectively. I couldn't show her affection because I didn't feel anything. I couldn't reciprocate kind gestures, I couldn't show interest or enthusiasm, I couldn't give her any of the things she deserves from her partner. 

And then she asks me if I still want to be with her, if she should stick around. My current state of mind makes this an immediate no. In this moment I don't feel anything for her. I know she's trying so hard to support me through this. But I know that I cared about her before the depression, what 2 weeks ago? Mentally I know that I care, and would care if I wasn't depressed. But now there's a conflict, is that going to really come back? How can I know? Do I actually not have feelings for her anymore? Or am I just depressed? 
I told her in a roundabout way that I don't want to answer that while I feel numb and nothingness about everything, because that's where my answer would be based. 

I should have just told her what I was or wasn't feeling. I was scared to admit that I didn't feel anything. It didn't feel like something I could come back from. 

Anyways I kept being depressed and distant and negative and just a shitty partner in general. I realized I don't know how long this depression will last. The last time it took months to resolve with meds. I couldn't keep dragging her along with me, neglecting her and making her feel unwanted while she continues to support me.

I decided to end things with her the other day. I've started on wellbutrin and am starting to feel a bit more. And now I'm just feeling floods of guilt. I hate that I put her through this. She's so sweet and kind and all I did was hurt her and then leave. I couldn't even properly apologize to her. I tried to explain and I just fucked everything up and made things worse and more hurtful for both of us. And now I feel overwhelming sadness, regret and despair, but I guess that's something. 

Also we were LDR which makes everything harder already.

,depression,"No, I'm not thinking about suicide or anything of the like.

I just look at my life and I feel like I gave up on living.

I've been seeing a therapist since 2017, and she helps me a lot. Yet I cannot help but notice that things got just worse since then. Of course not her fault.

I started seeing her because I had just been promoted CTO of the company I've been working since the beginning of my career 12 years prior.

I was extremely proud of that achievement, yet I felt everything else was amiss. No girlfriend, friends only from work.

6 years later and things just got worse. I decided to leave the job because of incompatibility with the CEO.

I started my own consulting company and I have done very interesting things for a customer for 18 months.

Then 5 months of no contract and now I took a developer job that gives me no satisfaction despite the team being amazing. I guess I feel  my work not having the impact it once had. I know it's not true, but it doesn't feel like it.

Why am I writing here? No idea. I just needed an outlet for my thoughts. I feel ashamed of how I feel and today for the first time I voiced these doubts to my therapist.

I have few friends but I am afraid of sharing this with them because i don't want to become a bargain to them. I feel like that if I told them how lonely I am, how much I crave for our monthly boardgame session, they'd start meeting me out of pity.

15 years ago I uplifted my roots and moved half a continent away, from southern Italy to Sweden and being a computer person, while social, I've always lacked the ability to initiate a contact. Now it feels and impossible feat.

And I feel like time has past. So I work, getting frustrated for what I do, then go home and binge tv series or videogames.

This weekend I played 20 hours to a videogame which I enjoy because it allows me to focus on something that it's not myself.

I guess I could call it a drug.

And i know this negativity is affecting everything. I'm touchy, somehow aggressive (not phisically).

I had few matches on Tinder and Feeld and let them go dry because I didn't feel like putting the effort on meeting someone just to get disappointed again.

The therapist says I should use these thoughts to find the strength to move forward. But I see no forward. And I really feel powerless about things happening around me. I just feel like carrying on.

I wish I could tell someone, my mom, my dad, my sister. But they live far and I don't want them to worry. And when they try to ask, I bolt out of the phone call to avoid facing them. 40 year-old acting like a baby.

So I'm writing here. Not sure why. I just felt like typing down things as they came to my mind. A crappy stream of consciousness, Joyce must be spinning fast...

,depression,"For almost a year now, I don’t think I’ve had any physical reaction to emotion besides bad ones (angry, anxious). The last time I cried was about October of last year, and I think crying would help me start feeling again, but I can’t feel the sadness in my mind so I can’t cry. It feels like there is just nothing where my heart is; not like “my heart dropped” from fear, it literally feels like nothing is there. I tried talking to my mom about it and she kind of helped, she said I might just feel overwhelmed and my brain is shutting it down, but she couldn’t think of a solution.

This has also started affecting my school life. I’m almost 15 and I’m already starting to build my college applications, and I know it’s important, but since I don’t really feel anything, I don’t feel motivated to try hard in school or do any extracurricular activities. It just feels like there is so much I have to get right to be where I want to be later on in life, and I don’t think I’ll manage to do it all correctly. I only ever really feel motivated when I’m angry, and waterpolo is fun when I’m angry, but other than that I don’t put effort into much anymore. Now instead of feeling sad or feeling worry about upcoming assignments or tasks, I just think that I feel it as if it were just a stray thought in my mind that floats away moments later and I forget about it. Then it comes to bite me in the ass when I don’t do it, but I don’t really care because I don’t feel any emotion about it.

I’ve always had random moments just thinking about how small we are in the grand scheme of things, and it usually leads to a few minutes of “nothing really matters at all” but then I move on. I’ve felt this (physically) for the past year almost.

Another part of this whole thing is that one of my friends is the stereotypical “golden child”. Blonde hair, blue eyes, and height for him to unintentionally steal any girl I try to talk to, straight A’s seemingly without effort, and he’s funny. Usually though, his funny to other people is just mocking me or condescending to me for no reason. Whenever it feels like I accomplished something, either he’s already done it better than I have, or he’s going to. Everyone loves him and my friends won’t hang out if he doesn’t want to. My mom even said he’s a perfect child and “she’d love to have a (friend’s name)”. This just invalidates almost everything I feel proud about myself doing, and makes it hard to value accomplishments.

TL:DR, I don’t physically feel any emotions besides anger and nervousness, even embarrassment sometimes if I’m lucky. It’s started to affect my school life and it is ruining my grades and motivation/work ethic, but I don’t know what caused it or how to fix it.

I have a pretty messed up sleeping pattern, sometimes I  go to bed very late because I do not get tired early enough and I almost  always sleep in. I am feeling super tired the whole day, mostly sitting  and lying around and even light exercise exhausts me mentally and  physically almost immediately. It is as if I just ran for an hour, but  constant. I do not particularly like myself these days, I do not like  that I am masturbating that often, that I have no confidence around  girls or strangers of any kind. I feel guilty about watching porn more  often than I want to, I feel bad that I am apparently too weak to talk  to anybody about this and I just feel like less of a human because of my  arthritis and my fucked up legs. I have lost interest in most hobbies,  at least the creative-expressive hobbies where you need energy to  participate. I still watch movies and serieses and play videogames with  my friends, but I end up feeling guilty because of that as well. Not  having anybody to share the things I actually enjoy (like playing  instruments, making music, taking photos or writing) makes it hard for  me to do those as well. I am also really not interested in people any  more, whenever I listen to the stories my parents tell, I notice that I  am not at all emotionally invested and I just nod along. I do not feel  particularly restless, rather I feel like I am not moving at all in my  life.

I am not really losing weight (although I do not check my  weight all that regularly), but what I noticed just today is that I  think about what to eat and I am really hungry, but discard everything I  think of in my head, because I seem to be having just raw hunger, no appetite. Like every food I think of just feels bland and  interchangeable in my head. I do eventually eat something and I usually  enjoy it, but the decisionmaking process is a hint I think. Now I do not  actually consider suicide as an option, but I am worried about  occasional intrusive thoughts.

Hi my name is K and I'm depressed.

I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. There's always been a lingering sadness in my chest. I've almost become dependent on it. It's the only real constant that's ever been in my life. Even in my happiest moments, if I paused for even a millisecond I could feel it there. Weighing me down, keeping me grounded. 

Its not fair to the people around me to have to deal with such sadness. A sadness that was created just from existing. So instead of sharing or passing it on, I shove it deep with in. If i talk about it, then how can i deny its existence. 

I cradle its fragile frame inside a dark spot in my chest so it can not reach the others in my passing life. Everytime it's suppressed it gets a little bigger. Like a water balloon expanding with every drop of aqua. No one can say for sure when enough will be too much.

Eventually it will burst. I know this. Ive prepped my whole life for this. My only hope is that I won't drown anyone along with me.

I know he actually won’t but he has just done this to much saying “I can get 100x more angry then me.” He even threatened to fight me once. I again know he won’t becuase he dose care about me but it’s like just don’t say that kind of stuff. He also brushes it off like if nothing happened and just says “sorry I got mad” like wtf I’m going to remember this for a long time. He also brought up that “if I would go into your room and play on your computer you would get mad” and I told him I wouldn’t becuase he is my dad and he just said “Bullshit”. I trust my dad with my soul and he just did that to me. Not just that one of our older dogs might have to be put down tomorrow because she had a stroke or her diabetes is killing her. This would be the 3rd dog death (my parents dogs Koda (put down) and Daisy (just died on the way to the vet)) in this year alone. Not just that found out my mom is on meth (my mom and dad are divorced aready). I finally talked to her and told her that I was put into a mental hospital, and then she sends me some photos of herself and SHE LOST OVER 200-150 POUNDS in only 3 months. She is skinny af and she just ain’t the same person. I trusted her and she got rid of my dogs Patches (my brothers dog) and princess (my sweet little baby). I fr thought Princess to HUG ME becuase I didn’t receive much actual hugs from people. Not just that she also took my last check from my 2022 summer job and lied to me and then told me that it was a punishment. She also got rid of my bike I worked Weeks for. To put the cherry on top my dad keeps blaming that the depression I have is 80% my phone and computer, which actually help me. I even contacted 988 and they got me to stop harming myself. I try to get help and my dad is like “You know they will lock you up in that place again and there is nothing I can do” like that’s the point before I kms. They even took away all my knifes and I got so addicted to sh that I found “a item” (for Reddit rules) thin enough to fit In my phone case. I just can’t take all of this anymore. I ask for help and I don’t get it, I tell others about my problems and they use it against me, I try to be kind but receive the most negative things back. I don’t understand anymore, it’s like if god is trying to tell me something. I just wish I had someone to love me to. Yet I also have barley any friends (they are my brothers friends) and I have never had a gf and I’m 16 now. I’m sick of all of it, but yet something tells me that someone has it worse, but it’s starting to get hard to say that. And even after all this the list continues too. (My mom drinking, My mom moving and getting rid of a lot of stuff, being isolated in online school for 4 years becuase I got bullied to much in regular school, daily inconveniences, sh, getting FND, possibly having autism(I’m getting tested soon) doing stupid stuff when I was little like meowing under desk like a cat now everyone talks about it, getting bullied becuase of FND, having the worst luck, not being able to make friends or get into a relationship normally, and the mental illness I have, ext.)

This would be the 3rd dog death (my parents dogs Koda (put down) and Daisy (just died on the way to the vet)) in this year alone. Not just that found out my mom is on meth (my mom and dad are divorced aready). I finally talked to her and told her that I was put into a mental hospital, and then she sends me some photos of herself and SHE LOST OVER 200-150 POUNDS in only 3 months. She is skinny af and she just ain’t the same person. I trusted her and she got rid of my dogs Patches (my brothers dog) and princess (my sweet little baby). I fr thought Princess to HUG ME becuase I didn’t receive much actual hugs from people. Not just that she also took my last check from my 2022 summer job and lied to me and then told me that it was a punishment. She also got rid of my bike I worked Weeks for. To put the cherry on top my dad keeps blaming that the depression I have is 80% my phone and computer, which actually help me. I even contacted 988 and they got me to stop harming myself. I try to get help and my dad is like “You know they will lock you up in that place again and there is nothing I can do” like that’s the point before I kms. They even took away all my knifes and I got so addicted to sh that I found “a item” (for Reddit rules) thin enough to fit In my phone case. I just can’t take all of this anymore. I ask for help and I don’t get it, I tell others about my problems and they use it against me, I try to be kind but receive the most negative things back. I don’t understand anymore, it’s like if god is trying to tell me something. I just wish I had someone to love me to. Yet I also have barley any friends (they are my brothers friends) and I have never had a gf and I’m 16 now. I’m sick of all of it, but yet something tells me that someone has it worse, but it’s starting to get hard to say that. And even after all this the list continues too. (My mom drinking, My mom moving and getting rid of a lot of stuff, being isolated in online school for 4 years becuase I got bullied to much in regular school, daily inconveniences, sh, getting FND, possibly having autism(I’m getting tested soon) doing stupid stuff when I was little like meowing under desk like a cat now everyone talks about it, getting bullied becuase of FND, having the worst luck, not being able to make friends or get into a relationship normally, and the mental illness I have, ext.)
to who ever read all this thank you, it means a lot and it shows that at least you care. Thanks ❤️&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I (F36) have a boyfriend, M (M38),  who is obviously dealing with some very intense depression and has been for at least 6 months.  We've joked many times over the course of the last year that he's having a full- fledged midlife crisis (full story below)  and he's very open about the fact that he has symptoms of depression.  I'm here to seek support and counsel. I come from a family history rife with mood disorders and manic depressive episodes, so I'm no spring chicken. I've also had past partners suffer from it, and have had my own bout of circumstantial depression as a teen. What I really need is advice on how to best support my partner during this time, and any male- specific insights on the situation. 

In the last 4 years, M has lost his mother to cancer (yesterday was the 4th anniversary of her passing), separated from his wife and finalized the divorce in February 23', gone completely bankrupt after enjoying a very lucrative career that he gave up to pursue a startup, found out he has a 10 year old son he never knew about,  and barely gets to see his other 3 children due to his controlling, abusive, alcoholic ex wife. Suffice it to say, the man has been through the ringer. Because I only met him 3 years ago and we've been dating a short time,  I don't know enough about his past to know if this is the first time he's suffered symptoms of depression or if it's an isolated event,  so it's hard to say if this is a reaction to his circumstances or not. 

His symptoms are: went from being highly productive/ driven/ motivated to sleeping tons and having no desire to accomplish anything. He's eating very irregularly and always trash food. Stopped exercising completely,  when he used to be very active and enjoyed walks, hiking, going to the gym with me regularly. He smiles but it doesn't reach his eyes. I know he's doing his best to keep afloat but I can see him dying on the inside and it's starting to impact our relationship.  

He doesn't want to talk with a therapist and I don't think he's open to medication at this time, either. My biggest concern is that he is starting to voice that he feels like a piece of shit failure that doesn't deserve love. I don't know how to get through to him,  how to connect with him,  or how to support him at this stage. Nothing I have said has really impacted him and I can't force the man to see a therapist, so I'm starting to be concerned that this is going to be his normal state and I won't get back the man I first met. Obviously,  I'm also concerned for his safety because I know the progression from all the self-hate talk to suicidal ideation can happen really quickly.

•Complete emptiness, blankness. Only EXTREME depression/anxiety. There is not one second of relief I ever feel. Not. One. Second. Alls I feel is heart pounding unease, anxiety, self hate, dullness, and the worst depression my therapists have ever heard of. 
•I have no more likes, interests, motivation. I can’t feel pleasure from anything. Not even tv. 
•I CAN NOT talk. Nothing comes to my mind anymore. Nothing. I can’t figure out how everyone else is always chit chatting back and forth so easily. I don’t have any words that come to my head. There’s nothing there besides dread. 
•My brain feels like a lump of mud. It feels like cemetery dirt. My cognition and intelligence and curiosity is gone. 
•ZERO energy. Walking and even sitting/laying down hurts. 
•Reality feels very very very strange now. Feels like a whole different world now. Like some fake, dull, empty, boring planet. Feels like a stimulation. There’s no “oomf” anymore. No substance. I don’t feel “as one” or connected. It feels like purgatory. Everything just LOOKS depressing. Every setting. Just a void. Even the prettiest sunset or nature doesn’t give me any feeling. I miss feeling human. I feel and act like a robot. Who does not and can not talk. 
•I feel INCREDIBLY guilty about this one. I can’t feel love for any of my family members anymore 😣 love is what life is and I can’t feel it. Like I said, I just feel like a hollow, empty, void of shell. Lifeless. 
•I can’t feel empathy or sympathy anymore. I can’t feel compassion. Every time I see or hear about something sad on the news or Facebook, I can’t feel ANYTHING. It can be the worst story or picture about a child, family, death, or even animal and I feel NOTHING and it feels F*CKING TERRIBLE. I feel like a monster. Like a sociopath!!! 
•Literally alls I do is sit on my couch from when I wake up until I go to bed. 
•I go for a few mile walk each day, eat mostly healthy, stay clean, read books (even though I can’t enjoy them), go to an intensive outpatient program, and therapy. Nothing is helping. This feeling won’t go away. I was a HUMAN for the most part before my psychosis. I am a completely different person and I feel like it’s permanent. I am a vegetable. This feels like actual hell.

,depression,"Idk what I’m expecting the outcome of this to be but I feel like I just need to get it off my chest. I’ve been living with depression for half my life; I remember the first time I self harmed I was only 12, now I’m 24 and it’s only got worse since.

Every day feels like a losing battle to me. I don’t do anything, just sit in my room rotting away with the curtains closed. I have no friends and no relationship and all I want is someone to hold me and tell me I’ll be okay. I feel so alone and it’s so unbearably painful. The only reason I’m here is my family, and as much as I love them I almost resent them in a way because if it wasn’t for them I wouldn’t have to stick it out every day. I just wanna go now, I’m done fighting but I could never put them through the pain of losing me in that way. I thought about writing a note earlier and it made me feel physically sick; the thought of them reading it and that being the last interaction they have with me was just haunting.

I don’t know how to drag myself out of it this time, I’ve been here before on multiple occasions but I’ve always had friends or partners to pull me out. This time is different, because there’s nobody to do that and it scares me. The only time I feel happy at the moment is in my dreams, and then I wake up and reality hits me like a train.

I have no motivation, no aims, no goals, nothing worthy of being here. I literally don’t contribute anything to the world. I’ve lost people that still deserve to be here, that left behind happy families and friendships and whenever I think about it all I can think is it should’ve been me, they deserve my place on this planet

,depression,"cw sexual assault, suicide, self harm

3.5 weeks ago, my friend (A) in another city invited me to stay a couple nights at her place. I had driven there (~50 miles) and hung out with another friend all day, while I waited for A to text me back about when I should come over. She never did, not until the next day, and so I had to stay with someone else, who SA’d me that night. 

I went home and isolated myself completely for about 2 weeks. A texted me a lot, but I didn’t really look at the messages until then. I finally told her what happened, and she didn’t respond for a day. she has sent me so so so many messages about coming to see me and caring abt me and worrying abt me etc. which is nice but I just can’t bring myself to respond, and when I do, I regret it, like I feel so vulnerable. 

I know none of it is her fault, and she has been really kind to me and messaging me a lot, but I feel like i’m upset with her and I can’t get over it. she flakes last minute a lot, sometimes she just won’t txt back day of. she is one of my closest friends but I know I am not one of hers. she is so so sweet over text and in person, but the flaking is so depressing. I was so excited and she let me down again, and if it had worked out, I never would’ve gotten assaulted. I know that’s not fair to her but I can’t help but feel like that. 

I have a couple “close friends” but I know they don’t consider me the same, we barely talk. and since that happened, i’ve been talking to no one at all. A is the only person who has even reached out. I told my mom abt what happened, and even she doesn’t bother to check on me. 

I don’t really know what to do. I don’t want to lose her but I don’t want to talk to her. I don’t rlly want to talk to anyone tbh. I just haven’t been responding to her messages, I feel like I don’t know how. She said I don’t have to respond, but I know she will stop eventually and she’ll forget about me and I’ll lose one of the only ppl who care about me. 

I really want to die, I think about it all the time. I’ve been self harming again. It’s so hard to do schoolwork. I’ve been depressed for the past 9 years &amp; had no passion in life. I feel like I was finally getting better and excited abt my long term future for the first time, not suicidal, and now it’s all fucked up again. I don’t know what to do.

,depression,"I just made this account cuz I don't know what to do rn...its been five years since everything started and its just getting worse

im not going to self diagnose myself as depressed but I don't know how I feel

everything started when i was in 6th grade, i had started making excuses to not go to school and these weren't excuses ""like in not feeling to well i think im sick""..no i was able to convince my parents as well as all the doctors we went to get me checked that there was something wrong with my kidney and got diagnosed with kidney stone

my parents eventually realized i had been lying for 3 months after my last doctors appointment for the situation where my doctor kinda exposed me...but the doctor had asked my parents to get me checked for depression or any other mental issues

a little side not im from south india and culturally its very shameful to have any mental illness...atleast thats what my parents have convinced me into thinking

my parents instead of getting me checked decided to solve the issue by getting me pizza

i believe the reason i started making excuses in the first place was because not only was i being bullied but my best friend started spreading rumors about me that almost got me expelled from my school

my mom told my whole class about me potentially suffering from depression and to this day im known as the ""depressed emo"" girl in my school.

now 2 years after this situation, im in 8th grade and its covid time..

i start realizing i haven't been able to perform as much in my studies first thinking its because of being at home all the time but i started researching more and was scared i might be mentally ill ,so i go tell my mom i wanted to get help and im not kidding my mother slapped me across my face twice and spat on me...she told my dad as well and they both went on to make fun of me for the next 2 months

a year later i told them i felt scared around them and they tried to change...for about a month

and so many things have happened in the last 2 years..

yesterday was my breaking point..my mom started screaming at me in the car cuz I've yet again made her look like a bad mother

(we were in the mall with friends. all my friends bought what they wanted and i was upset cuz i wanted to buy a book instead of what they bought so i was a little disappointed so i just started walking back and forth to calm myself down)

i started crying silently...at this point i completely forgot about the book i was just more hurt my mother kept calling me ungrateful

my dad noticed i was crying and almost killed all of us trying to hit me from the front seat cuz i was a horrible daughter...I've never been so scared in my life

so much more happened when we reached home .At the end of all that happened i was forced to apologize to my parents like always

im getting tired of trying to make them happy the reason i haven't killed myself yet is cuz im scared of what they'll do to my younger brother.

but its getting more and more difficult with my parents never listening to my side of the story physically and verbally abusing me im just so lost

i almost tried overdosing 2 times yesterday but i cldnt find my pills

i doubt anyone will go through this whole post but pls help me and dont just ask me to go to a counselor or talk to my parents about my feeling..if you haven't noticed my parents don't care about my mental health and wont help with it in anyway",t2_nsxvili6,False,,0,False,I'm terrified,[],r/depression,False,,,0,,False,t3_12oykp7,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1681698560.0,text,,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just made this account cuz I don&amp;#39;t know what to do rn...its been five years since everything started and its just getting worse&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i believe the reason i started making excuses in the first place was because not only was i being bullied but my best friend started spreading rumors about me that almost got me expelled from my school&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my mom told my whole class about me potentially suffering from depression and to this day im known as the &amp;quot;depressed emo&amp;quot; girl in my school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now 2 years after this situation, im in 8th grade and its covid time..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i start realizing i haven&amp;#39;t been able to perform as much in my studies first thinking its because of being at home all the time but i started researching more and was scared i might be mentally ill ,so i go tell my mom i wanted to get help and im not kidding my mother slapped me across my face twice and spat on me...she told my dad as well and they both went on to make fun of me for the next 2 months&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a year later i told them i felt scared around them and they tried to change...for about a month&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and so many things have happened in the last 2 years..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;yesterday was my breaking point..my mom started screaming at me in the car cuz I&amp;#39;ve yet again made her look like a bad mother&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(we were in the mall with friends. all my friends bought what they wanted and i was upset cuz i wanted to buy a book instead of what they bought so i was a little disappointed so i just started walking back and forth to calm myself down)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i started crying silently...at this point i completely forgot about the book i was just more hurt my mother kept calling me ungrateful&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my dad noticed i was crying and almost killed all of us trying to hit me from the front seat cuz i was a horrible daughter...I&amp;#39;ve never been so scared in my life&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;so much more happened when we reached home .At the end of all that happened i was forced to apologize to my parents like always&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;im getting tired of trying to make them happy the reason i haven&amp;#39;t killed myself yet is cuz im scared of what they&amp;#39;ll do to my younger brother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but its getting more and more difficult with my parents never listening to my side of the story physically and verbally abusing me im just so lost&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i almost tried overdosing 2 times yesterday but i cldnt find my pills&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i doubt anyone will go through this whole post but pls help me and dont just ask me to go to a counselor or talk to my parents about my feeling..if you haven&amp;#39;t noticed my parents don&amp;#39;t care about my mental health and wont help with it in anyway&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hey there.

I'm an ordinary, not so good looking 14 year old. And holy shit, it's crazy that I'm even on this subreddit. I feel like I'm way too young for this shit. And things have gotten worse and worse the past year. 

Let's start with school i suppose. It's a living hell. I feel like it's designed for me to get anxiety. There's always things to study and it's just too much for my brain to handle. As I'm writing this, I should be writing my essay. But my brain doesn't work when I'm under stress. I've always been the ""nerd"" in school who gets good grades and such, which leads to even more pressure on myself to do well on tests etc. But I think it's been too much recently. Not only this, but I also feel lonely. It's not that I have anyone to hang out with in school. But it still feels lonely. All my childhood friends barely feels like friends anymore. I think it's because we've simply grown apart and they even have new friend groups. And when we're having lunch we can barely have an ordinary discussion with each other. 

In addition to my ""loneliness"", I'm very concerned about my future. Who I want to be, If I'll be happy with myself, if I'll be successful or not. All these questions that are in the back of my head worries me.

I think another reason to my mental health is nostalgia. Even the word makes me feel anxiety. I HATE growing up. Life was way more simple when I was 8 or so. Every single day would be divided into three parts: waking up, having fun, sleep. And I would enjoy it, every day.  I know some of you are going to think I'm living in the golden age. But here I am, still feeling shit.

Now to the part I could probably write a three paragraph about. The girl I love. It's just something about her that makes me fall for her. She's not like anyone else I've met. She's kind, She cares about others and She's BEAUTIFUL and all ways possible. I was skiing with her the other day. And I just couldn't help but notice that I was enjoying every second spent around her. I don't know if that's what you adults call ""love"", but I feel special around her. Like I actually have a purpose. And she makes me experience actual happiness.

I made the choice to make this post to get advice as I feel like most people here on reddit have the most life experience. I have genuinely no idea what to do.

Side note: I've had some rum and currently listening to VNV Nation, 'Illusion'...absolutely amazing.

The Guts: 

Two years ago my ex reached out to a friend on Facebook. Her friend was going through a hard time and my ex was immediately there for her. I loved that until I realized that she wasn't there for me.

I was broadcasting distress and was met with silence. I would just drive. No destination and no motive. Lockdowns didn't help and we have a son. We were both stressed but I tried to make it work. 

We were together for eight years. Engaged for two  of those years. I thought that it was all related to stress, but when I asked her why she reached out to her friend immediately and completely disregarded my calls for help..etc. The response was, "" I love you, but I'm not in love with you anymore."" Tough shit to swallow.

There  is more to all of this and I don't put the blame on either of us, but now....almost three years later, court, custody issues, her moving to the midwest (I'm in the north east) she wants to rekindle...

She was what I wanted, what I loved, what I cherished. I was thrown to the wolves, dragged through bullshit..yet, I can't help but think about having my family back. I miss it so badly, but I know that it's probably not the right move.

,depression,"TW: Mentions of self harm &amp; suicide

In spring of last year, I was in the worst mental place I've ever been in. My two best friends were in mental hospitals for attempting suicide multiple times and I wasn't able to talk to them for about half a year (they attempted at different times but both had their phones taken away for 6ish months. Also one moved to a different state a few months before their attempt and the other one moved schools after their attempt), I was burning myself, I hated looking in the mirror, I had no one to talk to, I was going through an identity crisis, I was in a shitty school, I dissociated most of everyday, my only support was distraction. 

I had never experienced genuine trauma before last spring, so when all of the external stuff happened on top of me being in an awful mental state, it broke me. But in June, things started looking up and by the time this school year started, I got a lot better. And up until about 2 months ago, I was genuinely so happy. I'm basically completely healed from last spring, I'm at a much better school, I have an amazing friend group, things are just good. 

But for the last 2 months, I've been feeling like something is about to happen. In the back of my mind, I've felt some of the same things I felt last spring. The self hatred, the dullness, the desire to sleep through everything. It hasn't been that bad though, like I can just ignore it and it's fine, but it's there. And everyday I can feel it getting a bit worse. It feels like I'm being chased by something and I'm outrunning it for now, but it's gaining on me.

I don't know if I have depression for sure. My therapist has told me that I've had a depressive episode (which I have literally no idea how she knows that because I've never told her any of this stuff, we literally just talk about ADHD), but I'm not sure if she's officially diagnosed me with depression or anything. I feel like I might have it though because I've definitely had at least one depressive episode since the episode in spring, but it wasn't as catastrophically terrible which is why I said I've been happy in general.

I'm really scared to talk about it with my therapist. Like I said, we only talk about ADHD so there isn't enough trust there to talk about depression. Like I trust her, but the trust you need to talk about your issues having to do with ADHD and your issues having to do with depression are two very different things. But I know I need to talk about it with her because although I healed from spring on my own, I'm not gonna be able to stay healed on my own and just running from my depression doesn't seem any more healthy than letting it catch up to me. 

I just feel like I'm trying to stay positive and run from my problems and it's not working and I'm terrified that this spring is gonna turn into what last spring was.",t2_c1iqhsmy,False,,0,False,I feel like I'm fighting in a battle and I'm losing,[],r/depression,False,,,0,,False,t3_12otpbr,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1681688652.0,text,,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TW: Mentions of self harm &amp;amp; suicide&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spring of last year, I was in the worst mental place I&amp;#39;ve ever been in. My two best friends were in mental hospitals for attempting suicide multiple times and I wasn&amp;#39;t able to talk to them for about half a year (they attempted at different times but both had their phones taken away for 6ish months. Also one moved to a different state a few months before their attempt and the other one moved schools after their attempt), I was burning myself, I hated looking in the mirror, I had no one to talk to, I was going through an identity crisis, I was in a shitty school, I dissociated most of everyday, my only support was distraction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had never experienced genuine trauma before last spring, so when all of the external stuff happened on top of me being in an awful mental state, it broke me. But in June, things started looking up and by the time this school year started, I got a lot better. And up until about 2 months ago, I was genuinely so happy. I&amp;#39;m basically completely healed from last spring, I&amp;#39;m at a much better school, I have an amazing friend group, things are just good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for the last 2 months, I&amp;#39;ve been feeling like something is about to happen. In the back of my mind, I&amp;#39;ve felt some of the same things I felt last spring. The self hatred, the dullness, the desire to sleep through everything. It hasn&amp;#39;t been that bad though, like I can just ignore it and it&amp;#39;s fine, but it&amp;#39;s there. And everyday I can feel it getting a bit worse. It feels like I&amp;#39;m being chased by something and I&amp;#39;m outrunning it for now, but it&amp;#39;s gaining on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if I have depression for sure. My therapist has told me that I&amp;#39;ve had a depressive episode (which I have literally no idea how she knows that because I&amp;#39;ve never told her any of this stuff, we literally just talk about ADHD), but I&amp;#39;m not sure if she&amp;#39;s officially diagnosed me with depression or anything. I feel like I might have it though because I&amp;#39;ve definitely had at least one depressive episode since the episode in spring, but it wasn&amp;#39;t as catastrophically terrible which is why I said I&amp;#39;ve been happy in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m really scared to talk about it with my therapist. Like I said, we only talk about ADHD so there isn&amp;#39;t enough trust there to talk about depression. Like I trust her, but the trust you need to talk about your issues having to do with ADHD and your issues having to do with depression are two very different things. But I know I need to talk about it with her because although I healed from spring on my own, I&amp;#39;m not gonna be able to stay healed on my own and just running from my depression doesn&amp;#39;t seem any more healthy than letting it catch up to me. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"depression. it’s a weight tied onto your shoulders. this weight only ever goes up and physically and mentally bogs you down continuously and endlessly. and there is nothing that you can do to lessen it. 


not only does it emotionally tire you, there physical changes that are brought about as well. your shoulders sag, your eyes look dead like endless black holes that lack all lustre. 
all your days become repetitive and just blend into one meaningless loop that you can’t seem to get out of.  


you try to get out of bed but the weight is ever so present, leaving you paralysed and unable to move. others see it and they say you’re lazy, you’re unclean. they see you not showering or having a “depression room” and say “i thought i was bad but looking at yours makes me feel better.”
they don’t know how to deal with this so they try to say “just do work and you’ll forget about it. if you focus on your tasks everything will be alright.”
but how do you focus when the only thing in your mind is the end? when the constant thought of ending things is always on your mind. the missed opportunities of what your life could’ve been seem ever so prevalent in your mind and you see no end goal that your life is leading up to. 


you’re tired. physically and emotionally but too anxious to let yourself be tired in peace. “this is wrong. i should be doing something. this isn’t right. this doesn’t happen with anybody. i taint the world with my bleakness and pessimism.” the thoughts run continuously in your mind suffocating every good thought in your mind. soon enough, you only hear the echo of such thoughts and slowly you forget that you were ever loved or wanted. 


no body is there to give affirmations as well cause you’re too scared to say it out loud. the idea of saying it out loud terrifies you because that’ll mean that it just became more real. when you say it out loud, you admit it to yourself and maybe that’s the motivation you need to take the last step. 
but you can’t be bothered to even do that cause you’re tired. too tired to finally end it all. 


you feel like the world is moving at a faster pace that you are. it seems like you’re watching the world move on from the other side of the glass wall. 
why isn’t anyone slowing down? why is it blurry and staticky? the only thing you see is yourself and how you’re left behind. 
your past failures start to be the only thing that are visible clearly. everything else just fades away into background nothingness. you’re scared but not scared enough. you’re not scared enough to get yourself out of this hole. 


after a number of times that this happens, this starts to feel familiar. you do not know what to do with yourself if you’re not feeling sad. you do not know how to function whilst being happy. it makes you uncomfortable. doubts of whether you deserve to feel this way starts creeping into your happy state of mind. 
that’s when you realise that happiness is only fleeting and that for someone like you, self loathing and misery is the perpetual state of existence and there is nothing in the world that you can do to escape it. 


sure, you might go to therapy, talk to your friends about it but deep down you know. you know that it’s only a matter of time before the darkness takes over cause after all that is the perpetual state of the universe and light is only there as long as there is something burning to produce it. in your case, you burn. you produce light until all of it used up and it’s darkness again. this time darker than the last time. slowly the intensity of your light reduces and the darkness become greater and greater. 


the darkness expands into a void, eating up your insides. you become a shell of the person you once used to be. you become a shell of what people expected you to be. 
but there is nothing to look for in yourself anymore. 
you’re left without meaning, without purpose and all you can think about is how there is no point. 
someone told me that’s it’s pointless to look for the point cause in truth the point doesn’t exist. then what do you work towards? what difference does it make if you live or die? 
you only ever impact 9-10 people in your life. surely they can sustain themselves seeing how there are 7 more billion people in the world for them to connect to. 


i’m thinking of ending things.  
i’m thinking of what the earth would be without me in it. 
i’m thinking. all the time. and i want to stop thinking. i want to stop feeling like i’m numb but feeling every emotion at the same time. 
i think about ending it oh so casually that it doesn’t alarm me anymore. it never stops now and it’s like a broken tape recorder that goes on and on and on. and i know that soon enough, the darkness will become too loud and the only thing i hear are the welcoming sounds that the end brings. the peace. the joy of finally letting go and not having to fight this battle every waking second of your day for the rest of your life. 


i see no hope from this point on and i see no path except the path of self loathing and misery illuminated, ironically, by the darkness. and i seem to be a constant traveller on that road. i want to stop. maybe there is no end to this road and it only ends when you decide to end it.",t2_d3og0f3c,False,,0,False,just something i wrote about depression.,[],r/depression,False,,,0,,False,t3_12p3kku,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1681709328.0,text,,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;depression. it’s a weight tied onto your shoulders. this weight only ever goes up and physically and mentally bogs you down continuously and endlessly. and there is nothing that you can do to lessen it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;not only does it emotionally tire you, there physical changes that are brought about as well. your shoulders sag, your eyes look dead like endless black holes that lack all lustre. 
all your days become repetitive and just blend into one meaningless loop that you can’t seem to get out of.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you try to get out of bed but the weight is ever so present, leaving you paralysed and unable to move. others see it and they say you’re lazy, you’re unclean. they see you not showering or having a “depression room” and say “i thought i was bad but looking at yours makes me feel better.”
they don’t know how to deal with this so they try to say “just do work and you’ll forget about it. if you focus on your tasks everything will be alright.”
but how do you focus when the only thing in your mind is the end? when the constant thought of ending things is always on your mind. the missed opportunities of what your life could’ve been seem ever so prevalent in your mind and you see no end goal that your life is leading up to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you’re tired. physically and emotionally but too anxious to let yourself be tired in peace. “this is wrong. i should be doing something. this isn’t right. this doesn’t happen with anybody. i taint the world with my bleakness and pessimism.” the thoughts run continuously in your mind suffocating every good thought in your mind. soon enough, you only hear the echo of such thoughts and slowly you forget that you were ever loved or wanted. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;no body is there to give affirmations as well cause you’re too scared to say it out loud. the idea of saying it out loud terrifies you because that’ll mean that it just became more real. when you say it out loud, you admit it to yourself and maybe that’s the motivation you need to take the last step. 
but you can’t be bothered to even do that cause you’re tired. too tired to finally end it all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you feel like the world is moving at a faster pace that you are. it seems like you’re watching the world move on from the other side of the glass wall. 
why isn’t anyone slowing down? why is it blurry and staticky? the only thing you see is yourself and how you’re left behind. 
your past failures start to be the only thing that are visible clearly. everything else just fades away into background nothingness. you’re scared but not scared enough. you’re not scared enough to get yourself out of this hole. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;after a number of times that this happens, this starts to feel familiar. you do not know what to do with yourself if you’re not feeling sad. you do not know how to function whilst being happy. it makes you uncomfortable. doubts of whether you deserve to feel this way starts creeping into your happy state of mind. 
that’s when you realise that happiness is only fleeting and that for someone like you, self loathing and misery is the perpetual state of existence and there is nothing in the world that you can do to escape it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sure, you might go to therapy, talk to your friends about it but deep down you know. you know that it’s only a matter of time before the darkness takes over cause after all that is the perpetual state of the universe and light is only there as long as there is something burning to produce it. in your case, you burn. you produce light until all of it used up and it’s darkness again. this time darker than the last time. slowly the intensity of your light reduces and the darkness become greater and greater. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the darkness expands into a void, eating up your insides. you become a shell of the person you once used to be. you become a shell of what people expected you to be. 
but there is nothing to look for in yourself anymore. 
you’re left without meaning, without purpose and all you can think about is how there is no point. 
someone told me that’s it’s pointless to look for the point cause in truth the point doesn’t exist. then what do you work towards? what difference does it make if you live or die? 
you only ever impact 9-10 people in your life. surely they can sustain themselves seeing how there are 7 more billion people in the world for them to connect to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i’m thinking of ending things.&lt;br/&gt;
i’m thinking of what the earth would be without me in it. 
i’m thinking. all the time. and i want to stop thinking. i want to stop feeling like i’m numb but feeling every emotion at the same time. 
i think about ending it oh so casually that it doesn’t alarm me anymore. it never stops now and it’s like a broken tape recorder that goes on and on and on. and i know that soon enough, the darkness will become too loud and the only thing i hear are the welcoming sounds that the end brings. the peace. the joy of finally letting go and not having to fight this battle every waking second of your day for the rest of your life. &lt;/p&gt;

Weekends are not fun. Spent the last two doing nothing, laying around eating and drinking. Really want to put a bullet in my head. Cant get a routine going of exercise, eating right and doing the right shit. I just want to lie around, eat, play video games, drink, jack off and do nothing. Just want to do short term gratification shit. Reality is don’t really have any friends and feel like don’t have a purpose.

What getting a therapist help. Having someone say the same old shit of “exercise, eat right and stop porn?” simple, just stop doing all the dumb ass shit we know is bad. How come every time I go right back to doing it? 

All I want to do right now is get a drink. Don’t want to do anything productive, lose weight, read, study markets/CFA or anything to improve my situation. How could I be smart if I act like a fucking idiot? I really wish I could just muster up some balls and fucking kill myself. I am so over feeling like a fucking loser and not doing anything noteworthy with my stupid fucking life. I absolutely despite the closest things I have to friends. Both are fucking idiots and I cant fucking stand them. 

Do other people really go through the same shit and beat it? I am pretty much hopeless at this point; have essentially given up trying to escape this fucking cycle.

,depression,"Me f(28) and my fiance m(39) are together for 6 years. In last 2 years or so, he's been constantly on his low side. Since I've meet him, he wasn't exactly a very bubbly personality, he was always with both feets on the ground, but trough those 2 years, he would always tell me how tired he is, how he doesn't see any higher meaning to live (he never told me he would want to ki\*l himself) , that he just wants to sleep (but he always gets up before me), constant complaining on all sorts of pain (head ache, back pain)...

Also, he is definetly struggling with being confident with his  appearance, he gained some weight but nothing that can't be worked trough. His father died from heart attack, and he got trough it well, because he didn't have a strong connection with him anyway, but what got to him is that he started to see that he is following in his footsteps regarding his health. He doesn't exercise, our jobs are 12h literally sitting at computer desk + he plays video games a lot when we are at home. His only activities are mowning the lawn and doing chores around the house. He is aware that he has to change his ways if he wants to live to his 60s, and is constantly pointing it out, but he never does anything to get on with it.

I tried to be supportive by suggesting to him to hop on our bikes and do few circles around our neighborhood, told me yea okay, I can do that, but he never does. I even tried to exercise by myself in hope that he will join in when he sees me doing it, he didn't, I talk to him and tell him that he has plenty of reasons to be satisfied with his life, we reached our goals, and that now it's time for us to enjoy what we made. We also have a nice porch behind our house, where we can drink morning coffee and enjoy some fresh air, but I only managed to get him out twice.

I could write more examples, but I think I managed to sum up the important ones, now for the part when I suggested to him that he may be depressed.

We were going home from our shift. He worked at different location than me this shift, so we usually catch up on stuff that happend to us, so we can get home clear minded and vented out. He told me about this one local guy and conversation they had. It went like this. L - Hey you, long time no see, how are things? F - Ah, it could be better, im constantly tired man. L - Yeah, I get that, I barely have will to get out of bed anymore. F - That's insane, me too! I tried to explain this to my fiance, but she just doesn't get it! L - Is there a age gap between you two? Me and my wife are 11y apart, so that's why they don't get it probably! F - Exactly 11y us too!

I stopped him right there and told him that maybe that guy is depressed. He then told me, by that it means im depressed too? I said, well maybe (and then I listed to him all the things he said to me in the past) and then he got mad at me and said - See, thats why you don't get it! I will never have similar conversation with you on this topic because you jump to silly conclusions like this! I told him that it didn't pop in my mind yesterday, and that I think he really has a problem, I just waited an oportunity to tell him that but he shutted me down and ignored me for the rest of the ride. He is still giving me cold shoulder and doesn't really talk to me, it's basically weather talk... If it isn't depression, than it's lower testosterone levels, but his masculinity is probably not ready to hear that.

So based on all this, I hope I will get some response wether or not my fiance is really depressed .... and what are my next steps, because honestly, he is sucking out a lot of energy from me...

,depression,"I'll try to make this short and hopefully it makes sense. I have a long history of substance abuse and psychiatry - since I was a kid. I'm on two antidepressants, and although those have helped in the long run, I still get depressed for no reason. This usually lasts from an hour to a day at the most, and I literally want to kill myself. Then I start piling my face with food or supplements trying to get the feeling to go away. I used to use drugs and alcohol for this reason but I've found that my depression gets even worse in the long run when I do that. 

So what I'm wondering is if there's something actually wrong with my body that is making me depressed, like an illness I'm unaware of or something. I do everything I can to fight it, and I've been fighting it since my teen years (I'm in my late 20s now). I have no actual reason to be depressed, I have a family that loves me and good things are going for me. Finances are tight but other than that, there's really nothing bad, and it drives me crazy. I just want to scream *why am I depressed right now??* 

It doesn't get any easier and that's the shitty part. You'd think that I'd learn how to tolerate it over these years and I still can't. I'm not lonely - I prefer to be single right now, if not for life. I try to exercise and I only have a hard time breathing and get winded, and don't understand what the huge appeal is.

It’s not even about anything. I have impending due dates that while yes, I’m not thrilled about, that’s not why I’m fighting back tears every second of these last two days. I don’t know WHY I’m fighting back tears. There’s no explicit thought that I’m thinking during all of this aside from how I wish it wasn’t happening, but it’s just an emotion and I’m drowning in it. I can’t stop sobbing and it feels genuinely unreasonable. I really can’t do this this time. I really really can’t. I don’t know what I mean, I’ve never meant “I can’t do this, gotta kms” I just. will lay down and die. I don’t know what. I just know I can’t do what’s happening now, I can’t handle it I don’t know why it’s happening to me I don’t know why it’s fair. 

I’ve cried wolf so many times I know I’ve exhausted my friends of it. I reply so slowly and infrequently they will never notice I’m feeling unwell, but even if I told them how would they understand the severity of it if every single meltdown I’ve ever had is “too much and I can’t do it”. It’s always the same. Every time. After 10+ years straight I know they’re bored of it. I sent a message to one of my genuinely best friends about how I’m even sometimes anxious to talk to them because I’m so terrified of not being the same person I was or say something wrong and they.never opened it. They never opened the message . They sent me a post about Michael cera unrelated. They must’ve read some of it in the preview but I can’t in my heart believe they would read that from me and ignore it and yet I can’t see how that isn’t what happened. They read the beginning of that message and decided it could wait, or maybe they’ll never get around to it.

I don’t know where to draw the line, where people say don’t treat your friends like therapists and your a horrible person if too much of what you say is about how much pain you’re in  but also!!!! Reach out when you’re in pain, your friends are there to lean on and support you when you’re struggling!

 that means that if I’m struggling too much of the time I shouldn’t lean on my friends because that’s not fair. If I struggled less, it would be okay because it wouldn’t be that often and it’d be fair.

That means I’m too mentally ill to have friends because I can’t be okay enough for them. That’s really toxic of me because of course I can have friends I just need to keep it to myself, why am I not content just suffering alone?

My brain just seems to think &amp;quot;ah sure can&amp;#39;t have that&amp;quot; and boom, the negative thoughts flood back in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They had been popping in for a bit now but I was finding I could silence them with enough thought but they have gotten worse. The self doubt and criticism I am giving myself is tiring. The praise my therapist told me to give myself over the smallest of things has just felt like me telling myself too many lies and I just can&amp;#39;t accept them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to be positive, I want to be better and yet the comfort zone of being miserable because it&amp;#39;s what I know seems to be my default setting. I guess it&amp;#39;s just my brain going back to what it knows. Sucks but seems to be how it is sometimes. Just hate that my head is hurting again from all the negatively in my head telling me to off myself or just telling me I&amp;#39;m worthless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway little vent over, maybe this will help me a little bit who knows. Am going to try and sleep if this pain in my head goes away.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I was doing better. I had gotten on antidepressants, I was beginning to be more open, and I was starting to actually enjoy life. Hell, I’d even made some cool new friends and made plans to do stuff with them.  
 But it’s coming back again. The edging restlessness, but the inability to do anything. A hollowed out feeling everywhere. I tried to reach out to the people who I thought I could trust most, and they totally rejected me. And just like that, I’m scared to open up again. They’re ever so happy to help when they themselves don’t have to do any work. But heaven forbid I try to talk to them about things they can change to help in this healing process. That’s just too much to ask for.

Its not like I’m asking for them to bow to my every whim, and let me do whatever I want. All I’ve asked for is understanding and empathy, a chance to sit down and say what I want to say without them interrupting and going like, “Oh well actually we have it way worse imagine how bad my life has been and anyways I think you’re just being dramatic.” 

They think that because they can manage to do things when they’re depressed means that I must be able to as well. I hate it. It feels like they can’t put aside their own personal experiences to just sit down and listen. Even when they’re quiet I can see in their faces that they’ve already made their decision on the matter and nothing I say from there on will change it. I’ve done so much to bend to their will, changing so many things about me, pushing through pain and ignoring what I know will make me better, all to please them. I don‘t think what I’ve asked for is too much.

Any progress made feels pointless. I’ve been getting better sure, but one bad day later and all that effort is wasted. I try to hold on, because a new day will come, things do get better, how I feel now might not be how I feel tomorrow. But it’s so fucking all-consuming, it touches everything in my life and I don’t know if anyone I know in person really gets that. Certainly not the people mentioned above.

I had gotten on antidepressants, I was beginning to be more open, and I was starting to actually enjoy life. Hell, I’d even made some cool new friends and made plans to do stuff with them.&lt;br/&gt;
 But it’s coming back again. The edging restlessness, but the inability to do anything. A hollowed out feeling everywhere. I tried to reach out to the people who I thought I could trust most, and they totally rejected me. And just like that, I’m scared to open up again. They’re ever so happy to help when they themselves don’t have to do any work. But heaven forbid I try to talk to them about things they can change to help in this healing process. That’s just too much to ask for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its not like I’m asking for them to bow to my every whim, and let me do whatever I want. All I’ve asked for is understanding and empathy, a chance to sit down and say what I want to say without them interrupting and going like, “Oh well actually we have it way worse imagine how bad my life has been and anyways I think you’re just being dramatic.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They think that because they can manage to do things when they’re depressed means that I must be able to as well. I hate it. It feels like they can’t put aside their own personal experiences to just sit down and listen. Even when they’re quiet I can see in their faces that they’ve already made their decision on the matter and nothing I say from there on will change it. I’ve done so much to bend to their will, changing so many things about me, pushing through pain and ignoring what I know will make me better, all to please them. I don‘t think what I’ve asked for is too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any progress made feels pointless. I’ve been getting better sure, but one bad day later and all that effort is wasted. I try to hold on, because a new day will come, things do get better, how I feel now might not be how I feel tomorrow. But it’s so fucking all-consuming, it touches everything in my life and I don’t know if anyone I know in person really gets that. Certainly not the people mentioned above. All the support I get doesn’t reach me, because it just feels so forced and vague. They mean well, I know, but it has no effect on me at all.&lt;/p&gt;

I felt the best and i met someone i liked they cheated on me but that's not where I started my downfall.

,depression,"I''ve always had long standing depression and anxiety, and have been looking for another outlet. Recently someone suggested poetry as a way to capture and disseminate my feelings. Here are a few so far...


1) Today...

Today was a struggle.
Today was fun.
Today was dark.
Today was warm.
Today I spent time with my friends.
Today I was alone.
It's amazing, it's hard, it's inspiring, it's sad,
How you can have the good and the bad, perfectly intertwine in a conflicting harmony, to look good at a glance, but be empty inside


2) Choices (Medicine)..

This is the choice that I had.
To smile, be happy, to worry, to feel.
Or be dull, muted, jaded and cold.
To be anxious, to laugh, to cry, to reel,
Or ambivalent, slow, low, and concealed.
This is the choice that I had.
I could feel, be human, or not, be a shadow,
I could flourish and bounce off emotions, be high,
Or be stuck on one level, be still, and unkind.
This is the choice that I had.
What choice is it though, to feel or to not,
To be one with the world, or be lonely and rot.
Is this a choice that I had?


3) Sometimes...

Sometimes, just sometimes, I'm okay.
The world is at peace, my mind is at rest, I can breathe.
Other times I feel compressed, suppressed, restiricted, depressed. I focus on the woes, the dark times, the sadness, the lows.
I struggle to find purpose, to understand what, to understand why.
It is hard.
It consumes.
How can you be happy, how can be content, how can you be full,
When all you can think about is the hurt, the sad, the fear, the unjust and lack of humanity instilled on those
Less favourable than you,
Less fortunate than you.
If I can't be happy with all that I have,
What chance does the rest of the world have?

,depression,"I’m currently 26 years old but I’ll be 27 in September. For the past 4 years after my Dad died and the lockdown I have been severely depressed. Since the age of 22 I’ve barely left the house, I have no friends, no girlfriend. I have never even had sex, but I’m not an incel or a woman hater, I love women, I just never leave my home and have extreme social anxiety.

I’m afraid to reach out to my former friends. I am worried they will have matured so much and I have devolved so far that I’m ashamed of them seeing me.

I’ve worked 3 jobs in the past 4 years for only 6 months at a time each. I have no savings. I have made no personal progress over the past 4 years. I’ve gained 84 pounds over this time. I’m currently 250 pounds at 6 foot 1. I feel disgusting and ugly and I feel like I’m being watched and stared at by everyone when I leave my home. I constantly feel anxious and paranoid. I’ve developed OCD. I constantly feel guilty about where I am in life and not having a job, but I genuinely cannot face working at the moment. I am college educated and have two qualifications.

I feel so fucking depressed about the amount of time I’ve wasted in my life and that the best part of my 20’s are gone. I’m starting to feel suicidal. I’ve started trying to work on myself as I’ve lost a decent amount of weight (274 down to 250) but I’ve still got so far to go. How to I dig myself out of this hole? I feel completely detached from reality and like nothing is real, like i’m in a coma I just want to wake up from. How can I recover when I’m so far behind in life. I’m currently at an all-time low mood wise.

I feel like everyone I meet is superior to me. I can’t shake this feeling that I’m completely defective as a human being. I’m finding it harder to relate to people the more time goes on. I feel like I’m barely human. If I ever do recover, how can I explain to people the fact that I spent over 4 years of my life doing absolutely NOTHING. No socialisation, no work, no personal development. I feel like people will see me as a strange, boring non-person.

Any advice would be helpful and I’m 100% committed to putting it into practice.

&lt;p&gt;I feel so fucking depressed about the amount of time I’ve wasted in my life and that the best part of my 20’s are gone. I’m starting to feel suicidal. I’ve started trying to work on myself as I’ve lost a decent amount of weight (274 down to 250) but I’ve still got so far to go. How to I dig myself out of this hole? I feel completely detached from reality and like nothing is real, like i’m in a coma I just want to wake up from. How can I recover when I’m so far behind in life. I’m currently at an all-time low mood wise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like everyone I meet is superior to me. I can’t shake this feeling that I’m completely defective as a human being. I’m finding it harder to relate to people the more time goes on. I feel like I’m barely human. If I ever do recover, how can I explain to people the fact that I spent over 4 years of my life doing absolutely NOTHING. No socialisation, no work, no personal development. I feel like people will see me as a strange, boring non-person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any advice would be helpful and I’m 100% committed to putting it into practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

Little context about my life, I help my dad run a small company and between it and taking care of mine and my mom's house with yard work and ofc chores in my house I'm usually go go go. My grandpa also lives with me and he had a quadruple bypass last May. So I take him to Hardee's about 2-3 times a week and have to get up early to take him. One of my closest friends has also been going through a lot and been spending time helping her online with whatever she needs. So the type of life a live and with a business life it's really a lonely life and idk how to live it. I've gone on walks when it's nice out, go to parks, even had good laughs while gaming with my best friend and yet it hits me again and it almost feels the same. I've been trying to bring myself back to being here for me but right now I still only feel like being here for the sake of others and that is purely it. I also realized I'm almost always the one that has to plan shit to bring people together with coworkers and family if I decide to plan on one and I'm tired of it. I've been told I'm the only reason this family stays together but I find it hard to believe. And then there's times I feel like I'm not doing enough and I'm lazy. Someday I want to move to TN and told my dad I don't want to run the business anymore, so until I can break even on my house I'm kinda stuck. Plus Ill basically be starting from scratch since I'm moving somewhere alone. I'm 23M if this even helps anyone puts where I'm at in perspective. 

I even worked on my TV stand (I did woodworking as a fun hobby and put a hold on it for a long while) earlier today and after staining it and doing dishes I started feeling depressed.

There are obvious arguments for each religion, but the answers all circle back to the fact that whatever is above us is omnipotent and infinitely powerful. So any point made is void. There's no easy answer, and the stakes are high. You get it wrong, that's eternal damnation.

I believe in something. I believe that the initial singularity event is the work of something. But what? And is whatever god indifferent to our actions? Am I allowed to live my life until I die? Or do I have to adhere to strictures that I truly don't want to?

Maybe choosing to sin is fine, eternal damnation could just be another choice in the web of possibilities.

Depression didn't just make me feel bad, it slowly, through years, took away from me every single energy to not wanting to feel bad. What does remain in me? I feel so empty, amputated of a big part of my soul, and I don't even have the energy to say ""No, I want it back"". At this point, I just let it go, since I am rotting inside, and I don't even bother with it because that would mean spending energy and hope and positive thinking, all things that I lost many time ago.

I still did not find a dream or a reason to live, someone stole 500€ from my grandma last month.
My grandpa died 1-2 months ago and grandma just fell down the stairs she did not get badly injured it’s mostly just tissue damage on the forehead, but i don’t think things will get better.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I always did well in school until the last couple years before I dropped out. Worsening mental health and chronic pain heightened by social anxiety was the final straw for me to drop out as soon as I was old enough. 

The pain has somewhat improved, but the mental health has not. Part of that is that I cannot concentrate for the life of me at doing one task at a time. For example I can finish entering payroll at work in an hour if I’m listening to music, but if I try to do it in silence I’m repeatedly distracted and it takes the whole morning. I’m worried that this is how it’s going to go if I try to take the tests. I assume it’s going to be standard testing conditions with your phone not on your person and no headphones allowed, and I know that I’m going to get distracted by tiny irrelevant things and not be able to focus. 

I don’t know if my inability to concentrate is due to my depression or if I could also have ADHD, but there is a family history (including my mom and sister) and many people I know with the diagnosis have told me I seem to as well. 

I want to be able to have more career options. I don’t want to be stuck working fast food and factory jobs like I currently am. Honestly what’s prompting this at the moment is a desire to work for a specific humane pest control company, I think that would be fulfilling and make me actually want to exist. 

Either way, I’m stressed out now. I could probably get a passing grade on the test if I could take it in conditions that work for me, but standard test conditions are not that. That’s hardly even considering that they’re going to take 7 hours to do (over two days at least so that’s good).

,depression,"I saw a title on here that read; it feels like depression is my normal mood. I feel that. I’ve battled depression since I was a teenager. It’s never been easy for me to make and keep friends; my childhood friend completely stopped talking to me right before high school ended(for no other reason other than she was raised conservative and rebelled a little after turning 18 with a new, popular crowd). She’s since gotten married, had daughters, and even became a nurse a few years ago(while I had already been one for a few years)all in the same small town and I’ve never been good enough for her to reach back out to. I’m always getting abandoned by people I consider my friends and wondering why I’m not good enough. It came to a head after my first daughter was born and I suffered PPD bad. It took me awhile to get into somewhat of a normal headspace plus taking meds and going to the gym(body image has always been tough for me and it’s never been easy for me to lose weight). 

For a little while I was feeling good. I had my daughter, my husband and I were in a decent place. My husband had reconnected with a friend of his from high school who was married with two little girls. They said they were really looking out to hangout with some people that were in the same place in life—marriage and kids. We thought it was perfect. We started hanging out quite a bit; inviting them to our daughters and vice versa us to their girls’ birthday parties. We would hang and have dinner together at times, we went to a local beer/wine festival. It was nice for my husband and I to have people we could spend time with and our daughter was around the same age as their youngest, it was a win win. I did notice sometimes we’d invite them out and they would turn it down: there a nice little u-pick farm we invited them to go with us that had activities for kids. They weren’t really outdoorsy people, they said no. We invited them out on a double date night, they said no. They were homebody people, so we just hung out at their house or ours. I tried so hard with the wife to be friends: we had a lot in common, and a lot not in common, but I thought the things we had in common outweighed the things we didn’t. We were both working moms of girls, both married our high school sweethearts, we were both bigger girls(her more so than me but that didn’t matter)and shared our insecurities of our bodies(I invited her to the gym with me because I needed a gym buddy and that got turned down). Our differences were small: she was dark and edgy, gothy almost, liked the color black, tatted, etc. I on the other hand am bubbly(her words, not mine, but really I feel like that’s just the face I show the world)and I don’t mind color, I’m outdoorsy and try to stay active. Our differences didn’t matter to me. 

But the happiness just doesn’t last. Last year around the time I found out I was pregnant with daughter #2, my new friend had weight loss surgery. I was happy for her, I really was. She lost a lot of weight fast. I could see it was giving her a newfound confidence. The issue became the more weight she lost, the more her personality seemed to change. The last time I saw her was at her oldest daughter’s birthday party and she barely acknowledged me. I guess it turns out her husband and her were having problems. They separated right after that. I still had her on social media and would offer support but I figured she needed space and would reach out when she wanted to. Meanwhile, she was hanging out with a bunch of other girls, having girls nights, etc and posting pictures and selfies of her new body in crop tops. Her and her husband were able to work things out which was great and got back together. My husband stayed in contact with him while they were separated and we even had him over for Thanksgiving. The last time they talked was right after they had mended things. My husband has tried to reach out since then to his friend and has had no response. Their youngest daughter’s birthday just came around again and we received no invite this time but I saw it on social media and everyone else they did it invite. Now here we both are feeling rejection and wondering what we did. It also hits worse because it feels like a rejection of our daughter too.

In the school I suffered a lot also mobbing stuff and so on and there was a teacher always supporting me who also died because of cancer then.

Finally there were good times in my life aka I found a girl and was together with here for 4+ years but we had to break up because we were only argueing at the end.

,depression,"I live in San Francisco, and there's so many times I want to go exploring around, but I don't really have anyone to go on adventures with. I have had people who I've met and would go on adventures around the city with, but then they'd move away. I've had two people move away and a third is moving tomorrow. Just went to Golden Gate Park to meet up with them to hang out one last time. They've been like a sibling to be to the point where we introduce each other as siblings and everyone believes it because of how well we click. But I was waiting for them for over an hour before they texted saying only, ""I'm sorry. I can't do this"". So I started walking around the Park. I saw so much I wanted to do, but it'd feel weird going alone. Everyone always tells me ""you don't have to have someone with you to do things"". I know that, and I have had so many solo adventures. I've walk to the first tower of Golden Gate Bridge five times since I moved here June 2021. Only once has someone been with me. I've been to Palace of Fine Arts at least ten times, no one has ever been with me. I've been through the part literally countless times, someone has only been with me a few times. I go see movies every week alone, I've been to two plays alone, and I went to Outside Lands alone. I always do things alone. I'm tired of always doing everything alone. Like, I'm not looking for a relationship or anything. I'm just... I'd love to have a reliable adventure buddy who doesn't move away after a few months. I'm getting to the point where I don't want to get close to anyone because I start to get close to someone and then they move away. First one was on an extended visa and she had to move back to Colombia. Second one was feeling homesick so moved back to Virginia to be closer to her family. Now the one I claim as a sibling wants to live closer to their grandparents because the grandparents' health are failing and wants to spend as much time as possible with them. So like, I understand why they all left and that it wasn't because of me or anything. But it still hurts that every time I get close to someone, they move away. I'm torn, because I don't want to get close to anyone else, but I also want someone to go on adventures through the city with. Literally every time I vent about this with people, they're like, ""Just go by yourself"". That's not fun anymore. Now with my sibling not willing to hang out one last time, I've kind of hit a snapping point and I don't want to do anything at all anymore. Literally just laying in bed typing this when I could be gaming or watching something, but I don't even feel like gaming anymore. I have a PS5 with hundreds of games, most of which I haven't played because I admittedly have a problem with buying games and never playing them.

,depression,"(15M) I have been dealing with depression around two and a half years now and I feel like it’s just getting started. My family doesn’t know I have it since I haven’t told them. Why I haven’t told them? I simply don’t have the courage to tell them, my parents are also divorced so stepfamily etc also adds up. The only person that knows I have depression is my best friend, he has helped me severely all this time. 

Since highschool everything is going downhill. So let’s start with school i suppose. So last year I didn’t make it to the next grade, so I am redoing it this year. But I feel like I didn’t improve anything in all this time, although I am going to the next grade so far and I have studied a lot more. My friends on school, I had them but they are slowly ignoring me. I used to bike with them, go to the store, walk around school and have fun. Now I don’t get invited to anything of this anymore. I made a new friend in my new class tho, but I feel like we are just friends to have somebody to talk to. The rest of the class doesn’t want to do anything with us. 

In my free time I play videogames. Sometimes I just sit there, mindlessly staring at the screen of my laptop for some time, without any feelings or having a mental breakdown. I am also on a shooting club (fire with a air rifle, duo firearms being 18+), for me it’s very relaxing to shoot. 

Now for the final thing, if you are even still here. My mom gave birth to my half-sister two months ago.

,depression,"Apologies for the long post, read if you've got the time... won't judge if you don't.

**For context**, I've been in this fight for around 8 years now, since early high school. I attempted suicide twice in 2016 and begrudgingly kept going, with a lot of support along the way. I have a history of self-harm, though have been consistently avoiding it for a few years now. I also have to acknowledge that my past and my experience with depression was extremely privileged; I've been able to attend years of therapy and also attained support through antidepressants, and so have been relatively stable (albeit quite low) for the past couple of years. I do not have an issue sharing my thoughts and emotions with my family or close friends, but I still find myself feeling... empty, unfulfilled, exhausted, deflated, etc.

**Recently**, I have been in the worst state of my mind since my suicide attempts. **I am not currently actively suicidal**, though I'd be lying if I said the thoughts didn't briefly cross my mind most days. I have tangible reasons (relationship issues, fear of finding a job post-graduation, among others) at the moment for being depressed, and I am working on them in therapy, but I worry it's just not enough sometimes. I have been sobbing numerous times a day for months. I relapsed on self-harm. I have no energy to focus on finishing my master's degree, or to socialize, or to get out of bed every morning. I am so, so tired.

**I'm posting this because** my usual coping mechanisms and distractions have been lackluster and I'm not sure what else to do. I generally like playing video games, exercising, spending time with my girlfriend and my friends, though all of these are just feeding into my depression now. I'm wondering if anyone has strategies that they would be willing to share on how to carry on? The weight on my shoulders has been dragging me down for years and I don't know how much longer I can carry it. What reasons do people have to keep going? My reasons are running out and I just...

,depression,"I was diagnosed with depression in 2021 but was also diagnosed before then from a community college counselor. But I started seeing a therapist regularly in 2021. In summer of last year I had to stop because of finances and insurance. My counselor agreed I was seemingly doing better and we ended sessions in June of last year. Also was weened off of the antidepressants I was taking. By the end of October I could feel it making a return. I was upset about work, it was just stressing me out more than I think it should. By December I was ready to find something new I just wanted out. February I got a job interview and offer for a custodial position at a local High School.

,depression,"On the start of this year I told myself I want to get better mentally and physically. I've been struggling mentally from my 12, now I'm 23 and I've never get better, I thought myself, if I get to high school it'll get better, later if I graduade, later if I find job. It never got better. I tried everything. Changing my life, trying to find friends but failed. I know I'm not weird or bad, but I never had friends, I always wanted that dream friendship you see in movies, where you have friend that go out with you, you share your deepest thoughts, tell about your day, trust eachother and you dont have to be worry that you lose eachother. 

Loneliness been always in my life untill it became my only friend.

Therapist was good idea, tried that during high school and actually got little better, becasue talking to someone about my problems was the biggest change I've had, I never told anyone anything about my shit, I never wanted to know people around me to know whats up with me, because they would look at me different way.

After I graduadet, I stopped visiting and it got worse again, keeping that shit inside.

But this year I just said why I keep hurting myself so much. So I packed my stuff and moved out from parents house. Stopped eating junk food, tried to set the best routine for me. And routine helps a lot, I  never worked during weekends but now I'm working 6days a week and I dont mind, I actually enjoy it, because I cant sleep, and always tired so I told myself I could at least go to work and be there for money and not at home and do nothing.

Started to exercise lightly, been thinking about joining gym. 

Going to work only on bike and not by car. And it got little better actually. 

Yeah, I'm now more lonely, more with my thoughts but fuck it right. That's why I'm venting here, cause I find it just exciting that I'm changing and just doing so different stuff.

,depression,"Hi everyone. I could use some advice/inspiration.

I've lost everything. I was in love with a girl I dated for 3 years. We broke up and I was devastated but ended up making bonkers money for the next 2 years, made new friends, and had many fun experiences with new girls.

Eventually with the tech downturn I lost my job, but I had made so much that I wasn't particularly concerned and started daytrading (you can see where this is going...)

Ex catches wind of my success and comes back in my life. Almost immediately things get toxic again, and she becomes emotionally and physically abusive. I was always good with boundaries with other girls but she was ""the one"" and I ended up starting to lose my mental clarity and health. I fell into depression.

Fast forward 2 months, and in the same night I found out she's pregnant and had cheated on me (just made out with some guy as far as I know but still). We're not married at least.

I could use some advice/inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve lost everything. I was in love with a girl I dated for 3 years. We broke up and I was devastated but ended up making bonkers money for the next 2 years, made new friends, and had many fun experiences with new girls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually with the tech downturn I lost my job, but I had made so much that I wasn&amp;#39;t particularly concerned and started daytrading (you can see where this is going...)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex catches wind of my success and comes back in my life. Almost immediately things get toxic again, and she becomes emotionally and physically abusive. I was always good with boundaries with other girls but she was &amp;quot;the one&amp;quot; and I ended up starting to lose my mental clarity and health. I fell into depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast forward 2 months, and in the same night I found out she&amp;#39;s pregnant and had cheated on me (just made out with some guy as far as I know but still). We&amp;#39;re not married at least.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm wondering how I should keep trying. My anxiety is just getting worse and worse as I age. Even before covid. I have had anxiety and depression since I was a child. When I was eight I wanted to kill myself and now I'm 33 and I still want to. I don't have any help out here. I don't know what to do. I don't know how I'm expected to want to be here. I was hoping MAID would come into play this next year and then I could just go. But now that's being taken away and I don't know what to do. I don't want to be here. I've tried therapy, had a therapist chuckled and mimicked me for picking up my fingernails cuz I have OCD. 

I had a therapist. Tell me I'm too pretty to have any kind of anxiety or depression. I just want this treatment to end. I wish help was actually available because I am not receiving it anytime I ask for it and it feels like a sick game. How do people do this? Like I know I have to look for my own doctor but it seems all I'm meeting are people who think I'm faking it. So I don't know what I am doing wrong. What I need to do to change. I feel my mind breaking down more and unable to handle all those anxiety and then we have heart disease in our family. I just don't have time I don't think.

,depression,"I hope i helps people through a hard time, i just want to scream it out some where 

At the beginning of 2022, there were high expectations for the year. After experiencing the pandemic for the past few years, many people looked forward to more freedom and a better future. Unfortunately, many people lost their jobs due to the pandemic, and although the government tried to counteract the increase in unemployment rates by giving funds to companies and businesses to pay their employees, some employers were greedy and didn't pass on the money. I myself experienced this greatly.

Nonetheless, life continued. School was different, as the adjustment to real life had begun, and the fear of COVID was still very intense. Some people were against the government's regulations, and some supported them. Vaccination was a widely discussed topic, and violence was sometimes present at protests. Police enforcement was also present, and often entire roads were blocked, with participants cheering loudly. These protests usually took place on Saturdays, when I worked at a retail store in the center of the city, right next to the Stephansdom. At my work, I was asked to check customers' IDs as well as their vaccination certificates. I personally didn't pay a lot of attention to it. My manager also requested that we keep our ID and vaccination card ready to be checked as well.

At some point, the management announced that employees who decided not to get vaccinated needed to either have a certificate that they had already had COVID once or a negative COVID test to work. The regulations became stricter. Honestly speaking, I don't have a lot of memories of that year. It all seems a bit blurry. I saw my friends more often than before, and the change of being able to be part of society again felt good. To describe the feeling, it was like breaking out of an endless confinement where the future was unknown. The years before, starting from 2020, seem like a very bad dream.

In 2020, I lost my father in November, a few months after the pandemic started. Right after the government announced a lift of the regulations, a terrorist decided to attack the city, and guns were fired. Four people were killed, including my father. We used to run a restaurant in the first district for almost a decade. As soon as my father heard the gunshots, he tried to lock the door, which was made of glass. As soon as the terrorist saw my father's shadow, he fired 7 or 8 times. When I heard the shots near the first district, I was alerted and tried to call my father in the middle of work. I had a feeling that something was very wrong. I kept calling until our chef picked up the phone. He told me that my father had been shot in the legs, and I started to burst into tears. I ran to the nearest police station to find out where my father was. I couldn't find his location, so I tried to contact my other family members. My mother searched every hospital for him, but in the end, she could never find him. He passed away a few seconds after he was shot.

That night, I didn't sleep until I was too tired. I was woken up by my mother's call, where she announced the heartbreaking news that my father had passed away. I drove to her right away to try to figure out how we should continue. I felt paralyzed and numb, unable to comprehend what had happened to me.

,depression,"Men will always be primarily attracted to women who are 3 to 11 years post menarche, although they can feel attracted to women up to our late 30’s. Meanwhile, women tend to be most attracted to men around our age, sometimes up to 5 years older or a little younger. I’m aware that exceptions exist but it’s the rule that upsets me. I have other things I want to do but this issue gets to me. There’s also a 50% divorce rate and I’d assume most people cheat on their partner in some way. The only factor that can make marriage work is fear of God or genuine love and I don’t believe most people can experience true, long lasting love. I don’t believe monogamous relationships are natural.

Ive tried offing myself before. It didn't work. Gun didn't shoot off. I so wish it did. I don't think I'll ever be able to afford a gun that will work, and I can't kill myself unless it's via hanging out gunshot wound, because I don't want some random person being responsible for my death. 

Anyways, fuck this life and fuck everyone. I've already asked that when I come home, that a gun be loaded and ready for me to shoot my brains out. I'm sick of this goddamn world.

We sit here and tell these kids that they can be anything they want. That they can be some great person and that they have value. But they're so wrong. People are just born to be cogs in a machine. But when you're like me and end up a 5'6"" manlet, you don't feel like a cog that fits. You're just a defective unit that needs to be scrapped. People act like height doesn't matter but it fucking does. The amount of times that I've been stood up for something that I can't fucking help is ridiculous and part of the reason I can't wait to off myself. 

And then when all of this makes me feel sexually confused, I explore until I find someone that tries to rape me and then I beat the shit out of them to defend myself. Nobody will care but the fact that I tried stuff with someone of the same sex will mean I'm just a little faggot to so many people.

I don't need your.fuckig sympathy. I hope that when I'm gone you all can come to my grave and laugh at what a pathetic person I am. But not before you burn this pathetic society to the ground.

I have an interview tomorrow and I’m scared of it. I hate meeting new people and going to social stuff. I hate the way I look (I’m really ugly) and the way I talk and just the way I am.

I’m so stressed about my future. I am from third world countries ( Iran - India) living in a slightly more developed third world country (UAE) in which I’m a second tier resident. I am so scared of how my future will look like and where will I go. There is no way to be a permanent resident of UAE and I don’t want to go back to Iran or India. 

I’m majorly depressed and suicidal. I’m afraid to actually commit suicide because there is no method fatal enough to actually kill me 100%. I’m afraid a failed attempt will leave me disabled or disfigured. I have a hard time navigating life with a full functioning body.

I try talking to my family about my troubles but they just scream at me and tell me to sort myself out. I have no skills and I’m not even good academically. I won’t land a good job here. I’m so stressed out.

I heavily engage in escapism and that had led to people calling me lazy an unable to work but I just don’t hav the energy to do anything. All my energy is consumed by just surviving.

What a fucking waste, my life could’ve gone to someone who actually wanted it, some who would make something of themselves. I don’t.

I've been on this subreddit for a while now when it came to my mental health, but have always been nervous to create posts, but lately I just feel like I should. My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year, but there's been a problem and I'm not quite sure that to do anymore. Last night he was upset (most times there isn't a reason) and I tried my best to help, but sometimes I end up crying too. I feel really bad for this, so I have decided to take a break from the conflict when I feel like crying. 


When it comes to the actual problem, my boyfriend has been dealing with depression for a long time. He has been overthinking and self sabotaging got a while now and I've tried my best to help, but I'm scared I'm not doing anything and I really don't want it to get to the point where he breaks up with me because he is the love of my life. I love him more than anything.


Also, I have tried to convince my boyfriend to talk to someone like a therapist, but he's not comfortable with doing that because he worried about his family finding out, so when it comes to this, I have to do something and I don't have a problem with that. I actually like trying to help him.

Latley I've been crying as he as been hurt, so I've decided to take breaks from the conflict when I feel that feeling.

For the first year and a half before the adoption was finalized they seemed like the perfect family. We went surfing, boating, mountain biking, and did all sorts of other fun things. But then after the adoption they moved to Idaho. When we started living there they began to be abusive towards me and my younger brother.

,depression,"Ive always struggled with depression, since i was 7 years old.  There's always been a part of me that's wanted to try to get better.  I'm also an alcoholic, and again, there's always been a part of me that's wanted to try to stop drinking, and i have stopped, for years at a time.  

Feb 26th of last year my boyfriend died.  Very unexpected, he slipped in dog shit and fell and broke his neck.  It was the one day i wasnt with him.  

I've barely gotten out of bed since.  This isn't like my usual depression, though.  Despite my loved ones encouraging me to get help, i have zero desire to.  I WANT to have the desire but for the life of me, i can't.   Ive been hospitalized 10 times in the past year, for both suicidal ideations and also for alcohol withdrawals.  

I lay in bed and drink all day.  I've never been faced with a depression that is just like a neverending void that I'm falling deeper into everyday.  Usually, if my mom or dad or friends tell me how much they love me and how bad they want me to get help, it'll give me the gumption to at least try.  But now, like, i mean, i  have one friend thatll cry every time she sees me.  But my soul is so dead, that I'm just like ""sorry you have to see me this way"" but i dont want to fix the problem.  I do not want to.  

I think about him every minute of everyday.  Over a year later, i do, it may as well have happened yesterday.  It's torture.  Im told i need grief counseling, and if i could get myself out of bed, maybe I'd do that but right now it feels like nothing will remedy this kind of pain and id rather spend my time in bed than trying to fix an issue that i really dont think will ever be able to be fixed.  

Idk how to get myself to want to get better.  Right now, I've reserved myself to this bed and I'll die soon if i don't stop drinking.  My doctor said i wouldn't make it another year if i kept it up and honestly that gave me relief and made me want to continue to lay in bed and drink.  It's kind of like a long suicide.  I feel too guilty to kill myself, bc for whatever reason, theres some people that love me.  But the reality is, I'm still killing myself.  

I guess what im asking is how do i even get the desire to want to help myself?  Because right now, i mean i really do not.  Like i said, the desire has always been there at least and no matter how depressed i was, id still go to the dr for help, id still wanted to be happy or at least try to be. Not anymore.  Just feels like this is it for me.  

At the moment i feel like I've already died.  Efforts to make me happy would be futile.  It makes me so sad to see everyone i love watch me on this decline.  I dont shower any more.  I dont brush my teeth, even.  My hair will just get mangled into one big knot and i just dont give a shit.  Theres been times ive pissed myself and still not changed my clothes for 3 weeks afterwards.

  I feel like im already gone.  I just hate to see my friends suffer through this with me.  Idk what to do. I dont want to do anything.  I want to join him.  I dont feel i will ever be happy without him, he was the love of my life and i just absolutely adored him.

,depression,"I've been spiraling this last week. Had a therapy session (I've been going since January), and even though he didn't say it explicitly it was pretty obvious that my therapist was frustrated at my lack of progress and questioning my effort. And idk man, that shit just hurt. I'm definitely not always perfect about doing what I need to do, but I have been trying, and the fact is that my life has been gradually going downhill for as long as I can remember, even before I considered myself ""depressed"", and I genuinely have no idea on how to reverse that trajectory. Idk man, I've been able to scrape by in life up to this point, whether that's keeping up with school or seeming semi-functional to family/friends, but I think that facade is gonna fall apart soon. I've hopped on meds recently as well, and they just don't fucking help. They just make me feel indifferent as everything in my life slowly falls apart.

So I've just been sleeping through the days this whole week, honestly not feeling anything.

Had a therapy session (I&amp;#39;ve been going since January), and even though he didn&amp;#39;t say it explicitly it was pretty obvious that my therapist was frustrated at my lack of progress and questioning my effort. And idk man, that shit just hurt. I&amp;#39;m definitely not always perfect about doing what I need to do, but I have been trying, and the fact is that my life has been gradually going downhill for as long as I can remember, even before I considered myself &amp;quot;depressed&amp;quot;, and I genuinely have no idea on how to reverse that trajectory. Idk man, I&amp;#39;ve been able to scrape by in life up to this point, whether that&amp;#39;s keeping up with school or seeming semi-functional to family/friends, but I think that facade is gonna fall apart soon. I&amp;#39;ve hopped on meds recently as well, and they just don&amp;#39;t fucking help. They just make me feel indifferent as everything in my life slowly falls apart.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Every action that springs from me feels so wrong and alien. I just can't seem to do anything right, i cant even feel or think right. I stumble on everything and make a fool of myself. I try day and night to feel better, i fail. One moment i find a little leverage to feel enough to express myself correctly for me but the next is always something else, something else other than what I like. 

I want to cry for help, i want to cry. I have no urge to cry but i just don't feel right. I just don't know what to do and being a burden on my family Because i can't seem to get on my own 2 feet is horrible.... I can't do anything right and feel anything right, be anything right.... I just can't function correctly anymore. I feel defective and i don't know what to do anymore. 

I just don't know what to do anymore...


Everyday for 2 years i felt something wrong. I am not sure if something is wrong with me mentally. I noticed my brain feel like it does it's own thing and i want to blame my brain because i think i could be literally insane to a degree...when i just want to feel good and okay at all..... I am not sure if some drugs i took long ago damage my brain and I've had something damaged it became worse over time but.... I just want God to help me, i pray to him when i am in public and I'm not even religious at all... I hope that shows my desperation and feelings... I guess i feel so scared... I am not sure why either... I try so hard just to feel normal and i always fail. Being around others i feel like a disease... My mind is insane. I am always worrying if i made someone mad just by doing anything like walking.... Now i am doing things that seem to make others angry and i feel like i have no control over it... I am always frightened... I just don't feel right anymore....

Dont worry if you hate me... I cut myself with a knife and revealed the subcutaneous layer. I don't enjoy it i thought i could get relief but i don't. 

I am not sure if i am lying. I can't seem to get along with co workers and family, i cant allow myself to play video games because i seriously feel like i make everyone worse even by my appearance... I always have thoughts i am trying to make someone extremely and noticably dangerous like a biker gang member, angry so they'll or he'll try to hurt me or kill me or get angry at me. I feel like i developed things like itching at the sight of dangerous people (like biker gang) because i don't know.... My mind won't stop thinking about it and i don't want to make anyone mad, i don't want absolutely any of this. Yet I feel like i do this and i feel it so real... I just want to feel normal. My mind is saying ""i just want to feel scared"" why would I try to get someone angry enough to kill me? So i can die without suicide? So they can kill me in my sleep? Oh God, i don't want of this anymore... I just want to relax and feel okay, no thoughts of this nature, i just want to relax and be okay within myself and be okay with everyone else.... I just want peace

Yet everyday, anything i do, just by existing i feel like i make this world worse and more chaotic than before and there seems to be no greater solution than death but i just want to live and be at peace so the world is a better place... God i don't know what's wrong with me, if i am stressed, i just want everything to be okay 

I don't know what's wrong with me and please forgive me because i am just trying to find my way. I feel like a burden to myself and the world 

My mind feels like it's purposely trying to ruin anything good so choas persists and only choas persists... My mind feels like it only wants choas to persist and is ruining everything good with my will 

Something just doesn't feel right and i feel like I'm going to die

I guess i feel like i deserve to die but I'm scared to die when all i want is everything to go back to normal when i at least felt okay and normal.... :'(

I feel like I'm fading into hell or depression, this invisible torture, that forgets the pleasant past and replaced it with this unbearable hell, that leaves me debilitated everyday slowly and i don't know how to describe it because there's no definite proof, i feel insane, miserable, stupid, and i feel like i make everyone mad enough to kill me. I feel like I'm fading away. Do i deserve to die? Why do i feel and think this way? My whole being feels uncertain... I feel uncertain and i don't know what the hell i am. I just want a little peace, i want to feel normal and better, bliss. I am left in this hell, slowly rotting and i just do everything wrong consistently and that's why I feel like i am doing this on purpose to gain attention or to escape work, but i just want to feel okay i just want to feel normal and okay... I don't know what's wrong with me, am i a liar? What's wrong with me

Help

Ive thought about suicide... I wish i just had some clarity and know my situation, like a light. I don't know what i am going to do, nothing feels good, i can't feel right, I feel everything i do is wrong... I know no body cares and i wish i didn't have to type this but i just feel hopeless... I don't know anymore I'm sorry maybe I'll commit suicide and relief humanity from the burden i am because i definitely seem to make everything worse and I'm sorry for that. I'm always in self doubt and think i am playing a joke but i don't want to play any more games with myself or anything, i just want the truth... Not sure anymore of myself or anything anymore....

What's wrong with me? I need to be repaired

I just don't feel right... Constantly thinking of death... Everything i do feels inappropriate and wrong...

I just want to feel okay and feel normal... I feel like someone is going to kill me and I feel responsible because i feel like i try to provoke dangerous people so i can get harmed or seriously harmed but this all feels like a living nightmare I'm stuck in as if this isn't meant to be... I don't want any of this 

My life feels like a nightmare. My thoughts feel like a nightmare. My feelings feel like a nightmare. I act like a nightmare. I feel like a nightmare to everyone. I have a nightmare inside me and i feel like it's trying to get someone to kill me through impulsive and angry actions... Not in my control because my brain is insane and doing this without my consent or will, i feel like a puppet and it wants me to make people who are dangerous angry so I'll get hurt and die. My mind is doing this. I am in a nightmare. And i feel like this exact experience everyone will have because of me and i feel hopeless and responsible and i feel like i deserve to die because my mind is using me as a puppet to mske dangerous people angry at me and kill me and i spread this exact condition to everyone i come into contact with... This feels like a dream or nightmare and I'm stuck here. I feel hopeless and responsible and i feel like i deserves to die. I feel like I ruin innocent lives and i deserve to die. Do i deserve to die? I think about death alot... Maybe one day i will and everyone will be happier and relieved of my burdensome existence because i feel like i purposely put a hitman contract on me, even though I don't want it, i feel responsible, therfore hopeless because it's without my consent and i feel like I'm going to die... It's a full circle of me creating a problem and worrying about it but it never gets solved so i make someine angry enough to kill me (of course i dont want any of this) and the person will try to kill me. Do i get an adrenaline rush out of this? When i just want to feel better, be okay? I wish God could help me because i feel like hell... I think i am in hell... HELP! :'( i feel like someone will kill me and its my fault even though I don't want it... Please help me... Forgive me please... My mind says ""i want to die"" and i think i do but this inner choas is hurting me... That's why I feel like i am in danger and it's my fault even though I don't want any of this to begin with and why i feel like I'm in a living nightmare, stuck in a nightmare within and still living in reality which I'm expected to act normal but a literal nightmare courses through my being and i feel it's my responsibility, even though I don't want it... Ahh i feel confused and stupid. I just want to feel fine and normal and okay from my mind and feelings. I want to be nice and friendly, for everything to be okay and try my best but the opposite is happening and i place the blame on me but i just don't want any of this anymore.... I must be dying in some way, something just isn't right? Is this normal? I'm sorry. I don't know anymore what's wrong with me? Please help 

I feel helpless and hopeless and i feel like it will get worse even if i try my best for things to go well. I didn't want you to steal my selective wording and phrases but i needed to express myself and try to express myself well... I don't know anymore. If this is a joke, why do i feel like typing this? I feel distressed and i don't know what to do anymore, am i lost? I feel lost and i feel like i don't know where I am but clearly i know... 

I feel like i don't know where i am, i don't know how to portray myself correctly and i don't know if i am insane, if i have a disorder, if i am mentally handicapped, i just don't know what to feel or what's wrong or anything at all i feel so lost and ""comfortable (my mind says)"" 

Have i gone too far? With this joke? But it's not funny and i am not enjoying it. Am i trying to create more chaos in this world by adding this so someone is affected and somehow creates more choas in small ways, small ways we can't see? 

Was my drug laced and now i am permanently brain damaged? Do i have brain damage? Am i mentally abnormal? I wish i knew... I wish i had some small clue and knew what is really happening, with myself and the world... What's the truth... Because i don't know anymore i feel lost, deserted, hopeless, i feel like screaming out loud, i feel like i don't belong here, i am scared. I feel like curling in a ball and hiding in a corner forever.... I feel like transforming into a rock so I'm safe and can watch life. I feel like I'm reliving my past experiences any of them so i can escape the right now, which feels like a nightmare or dream. Not sure if this is derealization and/or depersonalization disorder but i just can't seem to find what's wrong or if there's anything wrong which scares e the most because i feel like I'm losing control and one day I'll lose all control and lose consciousness and not be able to know what I'm doing and not know anything at all, like the possible complete dark oblivion that possible awaits after death, the loss of consciousness, not knowing anything, becomign consumed and lost in complete darkness and no consciousness, feeling completely scared and trapped, intense freight and paralyzed completely for a long time and being hopelessly and very intense fucking freight and not being able to do anything about it for hundreds of years... That feels so terrifying. Am i writing the downfall of humanity? Is this a joke? I just want to feel okay

What am I trying to prove? What am I trying to gain? What's wrong with me, please tell me because I'm an idiot and I'm scared

I just don't want to die 

I'm sorry

I just can&amp;#39;t seem to do anything right, i cant even feel or think right. I stumble on everything and make a fool of myself. I try day and night to feel better, i fail. One moment i find a little leverage to feel enough to express myself correctly for me but the next is always something else, something else other than what I like. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to cry for help, i want to cry. I have no urge to cry but i just don&amp;#39;t feel right. I just don&amp;#39;t know what to do and being a burden on my family Because i can&amp;#39;t seem to get on my own 2 feet is horrible.... I can&amp;#39;t do anything right and feel anything right, be anything right.... I just can&amp;#39;t function correctly anymore. I feel defective and i don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyday for 2 years i felt something wrong. I am not sure if something is wrong with me mentally. I noticed my brain feel like it does it&amp;#39;s own thing and i want to blame my brain because i think i could be literally insane to a degree...when i just want to feel good and okay at all..... I am not sure if some drugs i took long ago damage my brain and I&amp;#39;ve had something damaged it became worse over time but.... I just want God to help me, i pray to him when i am in public and I&amp;#39;m not even religious at all... I hope that shows my desperation and feelings... I guess i feel so scared... I am not sure why either... I try so hard just to feel normal and i always fail. Being around others i feel like a disease... My mind is insane. I am always worrying if i made someone mad just by doing anything like walking.... Now i am doing things that seem to make others angry and i feel like i have no control over it... I am always frightened... I just don&amp;#39;t feel right anymore....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dont worry if you hate me... I cut myself with a knife and revealed the subcutaneous layer. I don&amp;#39;t enjoy it i thought i could get relief but i don&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure if i am lying. I can&amp;#39;t seem to get along with co workers and family, i cant allow myself to play video games because i seriously feel like i make everyone worse even by my appearance... I always have thoughts i am trying to make someone extremely and noticably dangerous like a biker gang member, angry so they&amp;#39;ll or he&amp;#39;ll try to hurt me or kill me or get angry at me. I feel like i developed things like itching at the sight of dangerous people (like biker gang) because i don&amp;#39;t know.... My mind won&amp;#39;t stop thinking about it and i don&amp;#39;t want to make anyone mad, i don&amp;#39;t want absolutely any of this. Yet I feel like i do this and i feel it so real... I just want to feel normal. My mind is saying &amp;quot;i just want to feel scared&amp;quot; why would I try to get someone angry enough to kill me? So i can die without suicide? So they can kill me in my sleep? Oh God, i don&amp;#39;t want of this anymore... I just want to relax and feel okay, no thoughts of this nature, i just want to relax and be okay within myself and be okay with everyone else.... I just want peace&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet everyday, anything i do, just by existing i feel like i make this world worse and more chaotic than before and there seems to be no greater solution than death but i just want to live and be at peace so the world is a better place... God i don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s wrong with me, if i am stressed, i just want everything to be okay &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s wrong with me and please forgive me because i am just trying to find my way. I feel like a burden to myself and the world &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mind feels like it&amp;#39;s purposely trying to ruin anything good so choas persists and only choas persists... My mind feels like it only wants choas to persist and is ruining everything good with my will &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something just doesn&amp;#39;t feel right and i feel like I&amp;#39;m going to die&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess i feel like i deserve to die but I&amp;#39;m scared to die when all i want is everything to go back to normal when i at least felt okay and normal.... :&amp;#39;(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&amp;#39;m fading into hell or depression, this invisible torture, that forgets the pleasant past and replaced it with this unbearable hell, that leaves me debilitated everyday slowly and i don&amp;#39;t know how to describe it because there&amp;#39;s no definite proof, i feel insane, miserable, stupid, and i feel like i make everyone mad enough to kill me. I feel like I&amp;#39;m fading away. Do i deserve to die? Why do i feel and think this way? My whole being feels uncertain... I feel uncertain and i don&amp;#39;t know what the hell i am. I just want a little peace, i want to feel normal and better, bliss. I am left in this hell, slowly rotting and i just do everything wrong consistently and that&amp;#39;s why I feel like i am doing this on purpose to gain attention or to escape work, but i just want to feel okay i just want to feel normal and okay... I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s wrong with me, am i a liar? What&amp;#39;s wrong with me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Help&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ive thought about suicide... I wish i just had some clarity and know my situation, like a light. I don&amp;#39;t know what i am going to do, nothing feels good, i can&amp;#39;t feel right, I feel everything i do is wrong...

,depression,"If there is any reason as to why my mom is still stuck with a severely alcoholic, incompetent and emotionally distant dad who occasionally buys us some grocery and calls it a day and has never supported us whole-heartedly when we needed it, it's me. Getting a divorce is bound to be a prolonged procedure and she doesn't want me to grow up without a dad. And it's true that as two women, one who is a teenager, who haven't got anyone whom we believe won't take advantage of us other than him, to seek help from, we can't deny that we do need his 'support' until I get a job and become capable of taking care of mom.

Worst of all, mom's health is deteriorating on a daily basis and it's a miracle she's still alive. Even if she can't stand, Ik she will because she wants to take care of me till I'm independent and that's what saddens me the most. I can't do much to support her as I'm still only in high school and that just makes me ashamed of myself even more. She is terribly depressed and I'm helpless and useless despite my presence being her driving force, as mom has clearly mentioned. She deeply loves me however there is nothing I can do to save her from this situation at least for now.


But I won't blame dad too much either because in the end of the day, just like mom, he was forced into this marriage. And I'm 80% sure that both me and him have ADHD but sadly, he doesn't want to visit a therapist and I have no means to do so myself. And I'll never understand why he still sticks around when he clearly doesn't want to spend his life with us and from time to time, comes home drunk, does crazy stuff and ruins our peace. Back when he had a lot of friends, within one day, he would talk to them more than he ever has to us our entire lives. We never got even a teensy bit of the affection he had towards his friends, from him.


This along with anxiety, depression, academic pressure, uncertainty about what to do in the future, self-esteem issues and my loneliness as an only child just make me wish I died peacefully while asleep. Every day, I pray that I won't wake up the next day. If I was never born, my mom could've easily left him and lived as an independent woman. Dad would've probably left the country and lived however he wanted to.

&lt;p&gt;But I won&amp;#39;t blame dad too much either because in the end of the day, just like mom, he was forced into this marriage. And I&amp;#39;m 80% sure that both me and him have ADHD but sadly, he doesn&amp;#39;t want to visit a therapist and I have no means to do so myself. And I&amp;#39;ll never understand why he still sticks around when he clearly doesn&amp;#39;t want to spend his life with us and from time to time, comes home drunk, does crazy stuff and ruins our peace. Back when he had a lot of friends, within one day, he would talk to them more than he ever has to us our entire lives. We never got even a teensy bit of the affection he had towards his friends, from him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This along with anxiety, depression, academic pressure, uncertainty about what to do in the future, self-esteem issues and my loneliness as an only child just make me wish I died peacefully while asleep. Every day, I pray that I won&amp;#39;t wake up the next day. If I was never born, my mom could&amp;#39;ve easily left him and lived as an independent woman. Dad would&amp;#39;ve probably left the country and lived however he wanted to. And I wouldn&amp;#39;t have grown up to become a miserable person in a miserable family, with horrible memories I&amp;#39;ll have to carry with me till I die. Worst of all, I&amp;#39;m too scared to end it all.&lt;/p&gt;

Life is piling on and I feel like I’m suffocating. I’m 43. Been living with depression diagnosis since I was 30. Been medicated for slightly less time. Living in a large metropolitan city. Here’s the list:

I am disabled from birth. I have a surgery coming up this week. It’s serious enough that I am thinking of leaving a videotape “last will &amp; testament”. It’s the first of two major surgeries I have to have this spring. 

My life partner &amp; I are in escrow for a house after years and years of renting. We finally are about to “get there” wherever “there” is. So there’s the stress with that.

My life partner caught COVID on their way back from a business trip this week. We are all vaccinated and they have Paxlovid, but we are wary as this might affect them long term and me short term, delaying surgery.

My minor child, who has had their share of tough life issues associated mainly with being an isolated COVID kid, today committed a Class A Felony in our city. This is completely out of character for them. I was on the road to do some local sightseeing with my mom (who happens to be in town) but of course turned the car around to come back to them, when I heard. I pulled up to the crime scene just in time to see my poor sick life partner talk to my handcuffed child calmly as the police put them in the back seat.

As the police pulled away my life partner (not minor child’s biological parent; the bioparent has never met the child, so my mom &amp; I raised them ourselves) started screaming at me furiously and motioning to go follow the police vehicle to where the minor was being detained in juvenile detention center. I don’t even think my life partner registered they were screaming, they were so distraught and in shock. They apologized later when I brought it up but yes..the shock is getting to us all.

After much back and forth I was able to bring minor child their medication to the detention center. As they were arrested on a weekend, they must be kept until their hearing on a weekday.

Now we’re back home. Life partner is back in isolation. I DoorDashed some sundries and we are all in bed.

The part where the depression comes in is that this is all a huge tidal wave of stress and I found myself hoping (not as a joke) that I die on the table on Thursday when I go in for surgery. I know it’s wrong to wish this but I wish it. It’s the depression talking. But I feel myself crumbling from the stress of it all. I want an escape for this strange surreal ducked up life I’m in at the moment.

I'm in a new chapter of my life, and in a less abusive home. On the outside everything is great, my skin is amazing because I've been caring for it, I'm always clean, I can keep up with my laundry and room.

I wonder what they'd say if they knew why.). I'm kinda just at a loss here.

I know I didn't just decide to feel this way, it's not fair to blame myself, but I'm just so frustrated with myself. I just wanna feel okay. I don't care if I'm ""happy"". I just don't want to feel like I'm constantly on the verge of breaking down, I don't wanna feel like my emotions are too big to handle.

I've been telling myself things will get better for so many years now, I'm starting to not believe it, but regardless I wanna keep fighting because what if things get better? I just don't know how to get myself to that point. I feel like no matter what I do I always end up in an even darker place than I started. 
I was told I can't be depressed because my brother attempted and ""actually"" needs support. To be honest I cut all of my friends off (they've been closer than my family for over 10 years now) so I was hoping my mom would be an okay support system. I was wrong, and now I have no one.

What would they think if they saw me like this? maybe they'd think I just went on a diet and got better looking too 🤣🤣 maybe I look good and it's all in my head, I just feel like I don't look like me.

i'm not a smart person. i'm easily distracted. i make the shittiest decisions for the smallest things. before meeting my wife, my life was headed to a downward spiral - drinking every night and spending what little wage i had. but i was lucky enough that she gave me a shot at dating her and from there, all colorful adventures, travels and experiences happened. things that i could never do on my own. she was the only one who showed me love.. and in turn, i tried my best to reciprocate. i'm not good looking, i'm not rich and definitely someone with a goal in life but when i'm with her, i feel that i'm the best man that i can be.

i'm not a smart person. and i've let my wife down more than enough to turn her love into hate. it is consistently painful that someone you love purposely makes you feel unloved by the most simple things; not letting you hold their hand, not letting them kiss you good night, denying a hug, brushing off your attempt at a conversation.. but then again, you may have deserved this by failing to recognize your love one's time of emotional need and support. 

i've heard the most painful words that i never thought i would hear - ""i'm done with us."" she said that with the most calm and fixed tone i've heard. i couldn't even get myself to construct an answer or even a plea. it felt like i was breathing in a vacuum and totally helpless. 

she is my wife, my friend, my life. and looking at her eyes now.. the way she talks and looks at me, is just unbearable. our endearment has been ""hon"" short for honey, and i get my hopes up when i hear her call me that but i know it's just a habit formed over 15years. its very painful that even in her sleep, she unconsciously covers her face to block my view. it used to be that she would share her day with me but now, i only share the silence of someone who doesn't even want to look me in the eye. i'm still stuck in a place that i knew, i failed miserably. its hard to breathe at times to think that the person you love is actively making you feel hated and easily replaceable. i want to hold on and work it out but my wife, my best friend.. my life, is gone. and she's just in front of me.

,depression,"Context: I am diagnosed with severe depression, Autism, ADHD, BPD and PTSD (My therapist has mentioned C-PTSD) But that's not a real diagnoses, Last I checked. The BPD having features of pretty much all other cluster B disorders,

I genuinely don't exactly know how to write this type of shit, So Ill try my best to keep it simple as I can  


My life is empty, To put It mildly. I don't exactly have anything in life to look forward to other than my delusions of which none will likely ever happen. I continuously push people way to my own fucking narcissism and unstable emotional state. I dropped out of school cause shit just felt so worthless, and I try so hard to work but I always just crash and stop at some point.  


And I would and have tried everything to be a better person. Like honestly. But it kind of just always leads to me sleeping my days away.   
As an example Recently, Tried getting into a routine.  


Working out everyday  
Eating healthier   
Meditation  
And practising daily of my hobbies

It went well... For about three days. And then I crashed and slept for 2 days pretty much only getting up to eat drink and shit. Its honestly just kind of not even worth it to try sometimes,

  
Another thing I have trouble is my emotions, I am emotionally always ready to lash out. I can't even really control it cause I wont notice it until its happening. which pushes people away. Making me feel lonely. This coincides with emptiness and the further degradation of my state and self worth. Which is always all over the fuckin place.

all just feeding back into the depression, and Its not always the depression mind you. I truly believe that I am really not a good person at the core LMFAO. And it feels like im never gonna change. I still try and shit, To be better but fuck man its so hard sometimes to just live. I mean ive tried taking myself out of this world numerous fuckin times lol  


I wish I was a good person, Inside. I wish I was a different person in general. cause this shit.

The BPD having features of pretty much all other cluster B disorders,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I genuinely don&amp;#39;t exactly know how to write this type of shit, So Ill try my best to keep it simple as I can  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My life is empty, To put It mildly. I don&amp;#39;t exactly have anything in life to look forward to other than my delusions of which none will likely ever happen. I continuously push people way to my own fucking narcissism and unstable emotional state. I dropped out of school cause shit just felt so worthless, and I try so hard to work but I always just crash and stop at some point.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I would and have tried everything to be a better person. Like honestly. But it kind of just always leads to me sleeping my days away.&lt;br/&gt;
As an example Recently, Tried getting into a routine.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working out everyday&lt;br/&gt;
Eating healthier&lt;br/&gt;
Meditation&lt;br/&gt;
And practising daily of my hobbies&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It went well... For about three days. And then I crashed and slept for 2 days pretty much only getting up to eat drink and shit. Its honestly just kind of not even worth it to try sometimes,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing I have trouble is my emotions, I am emotionally always ready to lash out. I can&amp;#39;t even really control it cause I wont notice it until its happening. which pushes people away. Making me feel lonely. This coincides with emptiness and the further degradation of my state and self worth. Which is always all over the fuckin place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;all just feeding back into the depression, and Its not always the depression mind you. I truly believe that I am really not a good person at the core LMFAO. And it feels like im never gonna change. I still try and shit, To be better but fuck man its so hard sometimes to just live. I mean ive tried taking myself out of this world numerous fuckin times lol  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I was a good person, Inside. I wish I was a different person in general. cause this shit.  &lt;/p&gt;

We're the kind of friends that just hang out and laugh over memes or something so we never really have had serious conversations about our true situations, but I know that he's going through a lot with his parents and maybe even something he hasn't mentioned. 

Today I noticed his discord ""about me"" thing said "" i dont have a reason to live anymore so uh if i don’t respond for a while i’m prolly in the hospital again or dead. gl yall :) "" and I just felt absolutely sick. He hasn't been as active in talking to our friends and me over the last week but since like 5 pm yesterday he has been completely offline (which is rare cause he's always on his phone lol). 

I got really scared so I started messaging him on discord and he wouldn't respond so I texted him on messages and his mom answered, who said he just got into the psych ward for the second time (idk for what) and I just really wish I could help him somehow but I just never know what to say or do. I've been thinking about making this post for a long time and when I heard the news I felt like I should try to finally get some advice.

After his first visit to the psych ward he got anti-depressants and he said they really helped so I though he was getting better but I don't even know now and I hate that I can't know. I really worry about him and it just makes me nauseous thinking about losing him. I know that he self harms and stuff and I wish I could get him to stop somehow but I understand that stopping is probably really difficult because that's the way he deals with his depression, but I really worry about his health and wellbeing.

I think, ""If someone was to help me with my depression, what would they have to do/say?"" and I can never really find an answer.

If you lovely people could please just let me know what I can do or say to make his life easier I would really appreciate it. Thank you so much.

(sorry if I do anything wrong)

,depression,"Hi all, 

I am currently on Pristiq and Wellbutrin, it’s has almost been a month 

Previously, I was on mirtazapine and also seroquel.


About a year ago,while lying down on my bed, scrolling Instagram, I was suddenly remembering some stuffs that was done to me by a tenant, it involved CSA, so I don’t think it’s a good idea to go into details as I don’t wish to trigger anyone. 
I remember the fella’s face, I remember exactly what he would do, and where he would do it to me.

I have the same memory coming to me when I was a teenager, but I was confused, I didn’t know what it was, I didn’t understand, so I thought it was just a weird dream. And was able to shun it off.

For the past month, the memory has been replaying constantly in my head. Non stop.
But now I understand what it was. And it’s like a sudden blow.
And it’s just simply haunting me!!
I kept breaking and questioning why didn’t my parents protect me or no one else protected me.. it is Pretty much making me very depressed 

The things is, this happened many years ago when I was a toddler that’s 30 years ago…

Why is it haunting me now????
Shouldn’t I be over it??
Why can’t I just ignore the memory ???



Anyone has any Advice?

,depression,"why, why on earth do people explicitly ask how I'm feeling, tell me to be honest, and then say I'm throwing a pity party? like I say, ok, since you asked, I hate myself and I'm suffering and feel guilty for everything I've ever done. and they go ""geez feel sorry for yourself much?""

uh, no. did you miss the part where I HATE myself? I don't feel sorry for any bad thing that ever happened to me cuz I deserved it. I don't just dump my emotions on people, I only do it when they ask. when they directly ask how I am feeling and want me to be honest.

of course I know it's polite to ask people how they are and in those scenarios I say ""I'm good"" just like everyone else does. I'm talking about people i'm close to, like my family. why on earth do they ask, with seemingly genuine looks on their faces, how I am when that's how they respond?

it's not just my family. lots of people are like this. again, I understand the common courtesy of ""how are you?"" but so called friends in the past have also told me to get over myself after I filled them in on my self-loathing after THEY ASKED. 

is the goal of this to help me? when I say I hate myself, they think insulting me will, what, make me realize my worth? instead of making me feel even worse about myself, that I'm wasting their time?

I can't tell if they're all right. but like. I can't just raise my self-esteem with the snap of my fingers. I don't whine on and on going ""boo hoo! poor me! feel sorry for me, the victim!!!!"" cuz I know I've actually be very, very blessed in life. I am the one who ruined things for myself, no one else to blame for that.

maybe that's it, cuz I made so many mistakes I am not allowed to feel regret. I'm not allowed to express my guilt for the people I've hurt and opportunities I let go because I was too busy screwing around. a made my bed now I have to lie in it, so to speak.

and I will lie in it. I accept the consequences of my own actions. I'm not going around looking for pity or help. I know that the dumpster fire that is my life is my own making. 

but I'm also not just wallowing in it, either. I have been saving money for months, doing research on where I want to live (cuz it sucks here). I am trying to pull myself out of it. but I guess that's still not enough. acknowledging everything I did wrong and trying to move past it, while still feeling remorseful and having yet to gain any confidence, makes me an attention seeker.

,depression,"Over a year ago I wrote about how I felt about the future and what was expected of me. I was soon to be 29, now I've passed the threshold and entered my 30s.

I spent my 29th year turning my perspective around. Asking others if what I felt was normal, it was. I got a therapist and confirmed that I was anything but unique. We're all suffering together and we can help end the suffering a little by being kind.

It starts with ourselves. I started with myself. With understanding my negative voice, with baby steps towards a brighter future. With changing my perspective on what I considered  goals and if I wanted to reach them. Or if society wanted me to reach them.

I want to thank those who commented on that post I made. Who felt the same as I did, who still might feel that way. No, the therapist didn't give me advice on how to change my life. I didn't even ask, in fact. I couldn't even recall at the time why I wanted to see him.

So I don't have any special wisdom to share that'll change how you're feeling. 

But we're a garden and we gotta figure out what we want to nuture. Those weeds that drag us down, smother us, drain us. Or the flowers that prick, that grow where we don't want, that look beautiful if only we'd put the effort in.

The great thing about gardens is their visibility. They way they attract certain creatures depending on what's growing. It takes a long time to weed, a longer time to plant and grow the flowers. 

And the flowers will die. Not every flower lives on the first try, nor the second. All we can do is make baby steps towards growing our garden. Handful of dirt by handful of dirt.

And weeds will reappear, and we'll feel like a failure. But if weeds can grow, so can flowers. 

Rarely is the gardener seen but always is their garden. Whenever I see a weed pop up, I thank it. For it showed me where to next plant a flower and improve. 

We're in this together, even when we're alone. Someone is watching your garden, waiting for flowers to appear, holding on to garden ornaments to make the garden look even better. 

If you can't see them, maybe it's time to plant a garden elsewhere. There ain't no sunshine when your friends aren't growing with you.

Be safe friends.

,depression,"CW/ suicidality 


Something I get about depression is how isolated I feel in it. For context: I don’t live in my home country, i migrated because of an ongoing refugee crisis (I don’t have a refugee status, but i migrate because of my country’a situation). And also, very recently, my dad (who was the only thing still connecting me to my homecountry) died. I was already not in the best place mentally and this made it worse.


Today I saw my friend’s who moved to other countries Be Reals and i got extremely depressed over the fact that they managed to make friends so easily and I’m here, attempting to make friends, but not managing to connect meaningfully with anyone. I literally only have one family member left (my mom) and a very introverted partner who I love, but I can’t realate, since he has a bigger family and doesn’t seem to need as much social interaction as I do.

I feel extremely depressed and isolated here, my mental health keeps worsening. I’ve considered applying to Switzerland’s assisted suicide program when my mom dies, because I don’t see any reason to keep going after she’s not around. Right now I’m mainly keeping myself alive because of her, I know how grief feels now and I don’t want to cause her this pain (at least not on my own doing). 

I don’t see any point on moving forward if I don’t have family or a “chosen family”. I don’t have people who care as much about me except for my partner, but I’m sure he will eventually get tired of me being depressed and sad all the time. I don’t have a “chosen family” because I literally have no friends with meaningful connection. I have casual “friends” , but they don’t tend to include me in their plans most of the time and I highly doubt it will make a difference if I died for them. Last time I got invited to something was out of pity (they knew I was devastated over my father’s death) and the plans got cancelled anyways.

,depression,"Hello everyone, I just need your advice and support.
My mind is getting dark again.
This is the first time I share personal concerns and issues anonymously and not to a professional and I hope I can get your advices. It is difficult to admit but I really need help.

I am a 30M
A little backstory: 
Starting with relationships with women, those have always been emotionally quite difficult for me. I either get too attached or I can not open myself up and eventually push the other person away. As you could guess I am still single.
I have lived to accept that my contribution to the relationships issues are more significant than the other partner, however I do not want to focus on what they did, but rather on what happens with me.
Few years back after many years of struggling to hold a relationship I found a lady which I fell madly in love with, unfortunately it was one way feeling. Anyway, along with the hard breakup I was in a really tough financial situation. There was also a lot of peer pressure from relatives and acquaintances on my life choices and career growth. I used to be a chef back then, and after the breakup I had few failed attempts to start a relationship, then covid struck. I have lost my business, went broke and had to ask my parents for a bailout. 
All of that mix landed me in a suicide watch, with regular in-person sessions and prescribed medication. 
Up to this day I still burst into tears when I remember that terrifying state of mind that I was in and the grim thoughts of ending it all. I call that day my darkest time.

I have changed my career and started working in tech. My first job after being chef involved lots of travelling and that helped me a lot to get a glimpse on the wonderful side of life. I have aimed at a career growth that I liked and started pursuing it. Fast forward to today - 30 years of age I have almost cleared my debts and I can start saving for the first time in my life. Career growth is challenging but I do my small steady steps and so far turns to be successful(would love if I could pick up some pace, but I have learned to give myself time). I make a decent living.

The sunshine always ends and I can feel something terrifying is lurking around me.

It all looks good on the facade, however the truth is worse than it looks. 
Since my darkest time which lead me to medication and therapy, I have gained lot of weight, from 200 to 300 pounds. Alcohol and drug addiction were very strong until not long ago(I hope I am killing these down, cause I am doing pretty well for over 8 months now, not completely clean, but I do not feel the need of taking or drinking). 
I have developed a small gambling addiction which at this point is manageable. 
I am starting to think that people around me are avoiding me or as if I am annoying them.(Which may not be the case at all)
I just recently had a dumb huge fight over something insignificant with my parents, with whom I am very close.
Everyday I feel like I am not worth it. I am single for over 3 years now. My confidence is gone. 
I started to judge my self a lot, but in a healthy way. 
Weed was a mediatory drug that helped me cope with bad sleep and bad feelings, however for over a year now it just elevates those disgusting feelings like guilt over nothing, paranoia, feeling absolutely worthless. 
I am also doing night shifts and I have health issues preventing me from training hard because that was how I used to keep up my shape.

I genuinely feel really bad, anxious and lost for over a month now. And I have the fear that I am heading back to that same dark place.

Believe me, I do try really hard to keep my mind as positive as possible, but I can see that I am starting to fail in many aspects of my life once again.

Anyone had similar mental and life challenges? How did you guys hop the hurdles or move the boulders on your way?
Do you have any advices on how to cope until I get on the right track to be able to overcome these challenges? 

Mental health for men is a huge taboo in my country and that peer pressures me as well.

,depression,"I have ""friends"" but barely. I initiate hang outs, but plans always fall through. I see them easily hanging out with each other, but never extending the invite to me. I hang out with them once in a blue moon in this like big group setting, but I honestly feel like im an extra or this funny/weird party trick of a person not someone that actually want to be around and care about as a friend.

I know if I were to say ""can we hang out today, I really need some company"" to one of them, they would say yes. But I dont want to have to explicitly do that just for a friend to want to make time and spend time with me.

I spend most of my free time alone. I havent been working recently so im alone with little to no communication with anyone nearly everyday. I feel empty. I feel like im nothing to ppl who are not nothing to me. I see the way each of them treat each other as individuals I am not treated like that by any of them ever. No one randomly calls me just to talk (ive done it and either no one answers the phone or I get treated like why am I calling do I need something specific). No one asks me to hang out just to hang out and spend time (when I do it they are busy or want to organize/schedule a big group outing when I dont need that necessarily I just want to chill and bond if that makes sense).

Ive realized it starts with me putting myself out there, but ive done that so many times and it just simply is not acknowledged or reciprocated by them. What am I supposed to do. This has been going on for about 3yrs now. I know that people grow and lives get busy, but you make time for people that you care about. I truly believe just none of them care about me in that way (and by that I mean the bare minimum feeling of just liking and wanting to be around your friend). Every new year for the past like 3yrs one of my goals has been to make new, strong friendships.. hopefully have a best friend.. hopefully develop a community/a sisterhood. I try every year. Yet I still just have no friends.

Its starting to feel like something is just wrong with me. Me being me just doesnt add value to ppl's lives.

Sidenote: I know the angle of going out and doing hobbies or activities on your own... I do so many things on by myself tbh.

I do suggest that if anyone is having trouble to seek help as things do get better and before anyone judges me or says that I should have seeked help I did contact the Crissi team and it took 5 calls and 10 mins of waiting each time to try and get through to anyone by that time it was too late for me and my impulse took over.&lt;/p&gt;

I hate that because of the medicine I'm self aware to know what may be causing it to flare up. 

Loss of social network and the constant revolving of hiring employees at work. Toss in some weird medical stuff and no answers. 

I don't have a plan or anything as I remind myself that I don't have a guaranteed painless way to go out. 

Instead I'm angry at myself for not keeping it together. I have had worse situations in my life and made it through. But maybe that's why it is so hard to keep going.

From drug addicts to abusive family members. The only bright spots I remember are playing with my cousins. At least when they weren't saying I was so stupid the government gave money to my mother. 

My grandma was great and is probably the sole reason I didn't become a monster. She drilled the lessons into my head. She built my empathy beyond what the majority of my cousins had.

,depression,"&amp;#x200B;

I have been isolated for a year now, with no friends, no girlfriend, and no life. Before 10th grade, life was great; I had a large group of friends with whom we would hang out, play games together, and just have fun. Maybe I wasn't so close to them, but at least I had someone to spend time with once a week besides my parents.

I was never really social in my life, because I got bullied throughout middle school, but in the 9th grade, I finally fit into a friend group. Unfortunately, in the 10th grade, I had to change schools because we moved to another city, and I started attending a specialized science high school. Now, I have absolutely no life. The school is really hard, and the main reason I am here is because of my parents. In order to pass my classes, I am forced to study for nearly five hours a day, almost every day. Throughout the year, I mostly studied at home and rarely went outside. This routine made me even more shy, and now, even though it's the holidays, I don't want to go outside. I look in the mirror and realize that I have no one to call or talk to; it's just me and my computer. I tried to make new friends at school and talk to people, but somehow, I didn't fit in. I even tried talking to the girls in my class, but they ended up calling me a weirdo and thinking I was hitting on them. The only ""friend"" I talk to in school isn't really my friend; he once snitched on me for cheating on an exam. I am at a point in my life where I don't really care about anything anymore, and I'm scared that this loneliness will never end. Sometimes I think a bullet in the head would be better than this loneliness.

,depression,"Do you guys often have a sense of longing after finishing book/anime/movie/TV series with deep immersion? I can't even put a finger on its source - do you want to exchange your life for a character in that story? Or do you want just to have this story continue forever thus giving you never-ending immersion? But longing is real, it eats at you like an unrequited love, sometimes for weeks, months.

,depression,"Okay, first things first, let me try to sum things up real quick:

I've been diagnosed with depression 12 years ago and I've been treating it ever since. Even though I wasn't diagnosed back then, I can trace my first signs of depression to about 18 years ago. I'm 37 years old right now, so I've been struggling with this for almost half of my life, and almost my entire adult life. I go to therapy and I consult with a psychiatrist, who has me on medications. I've taken multiple types of antidepressants throughout the years, and even though I'm more or less ""stable"" right now, I'd say it's far from ideal. I still feel depressed daily, with serious harm to my self esteem and social life. The fight is far from over.

Now on to what I wanted to talk to you about: recently I had a session with my psychiatrist, but a lot of what she said was really hurtful and it's been gnawing at me ever since. I've been consulting with her for a little over a year. Sadly I've been through a lot of different psychiatrists over the years, finding it very hard to 100% trust and rely on someone. I want to know if I'm on the wrong here, or if there's really some lack of empathy or understanding on her part.

First of all, after relaying all my recent struggles, the very first thing she said was to compare me with a child who has difficulty fitting in at school. She literally said something along these lines. I found it very belittling and humiliating. Look, I understand the point of analogies or metaphors, but of all the comparisons that could be made, I feel like something was implied with this.

Now, a lot of the difficulties I'm facing at the moment concern my current job. I find that I'm not valued enough in the team and overall I feel a lack of motivation. The tasks that are given to me make me feel as if I were only an intern, even though that's not the case. Her response to this was to say that I'm behaving like an intern, and that if I want to be regarded as an equal, I should behave or treat them as one. Look, I can appreciate that this might be some solid advice, but we should not forget that I do suffer from depression and that I have a severely low self-esteem. There's something about what she said that sounds to me like a variation of ""just do it like this"" or ""you should behave like that"". I can't quite put my finger on it, but I find it very *very* unhelpful. By making something that I find very hard sound like there's an easy solution for it, that in turn makes me feel even more stupid for having this difficulty in the first place.

For example, I'm back living with my family right now and I barely ever leave my home. My younger brother lives here as well (even though he's out most of the time), but we have little in common and we are far from being friends. My psychiatrist asked me why don't I go out with my brother or meet with his friends. My answer was that first of all I'm not friends with him and I don't care at all for his friends. She said something along the lines of ""well, beggars can't be choosers"" and that maybe I should make the effort. Alright, maybe I should, but I really don't want to. 

This is where I don't know if I'm on the wrong here. Am I seriously mistaken for being stubborn and not making these efforts? As far as I can see, I *do* know what things I want, what things I don't want, and which are my personal limitations and which are my strengths. I'm not a sociable person and I've never cared for the sort of people that hang out with my brother. There's not a shred of desire in me to go out and become friends with them.

Back to my issues at work, she asked me why don't I feel motivation to plow through or, I don't know, find things that I can work on instead of complaining about being given pointless tasks. Look, I'm a programmer, I'm new at this team and all I want is to be given clear instructions and tasks that I can perform. That's all I'm asking for, I really don't feel like I have any unreasonable requests or expectations. But my psychiatrist really made me feel stupid for not being pragmatic about it, I guess.

Look, I'm not arguing *at all* that these might be trivial issues to other people. I can totally appreciate that these are my difficulties, and mine only. I know that other people could go there and work their asses off and impress everyone else with their self-driven attitude and initiative, but I'm not that person. I cannot be that person, at least not right now. That's the crux of the matter: I don't have the energy, or the drive, or the communication skills to be this sort of pragmatic and go-getter person. And my psychiatrist made me feel guilty for it: I should just do those things, instead of complain about them. Why do I find it so harmful to hear this sort of thing?

TL;DR  
Okay sorry for the long post. Long story short: I want to know if you guys agree or disagree with me, and if you've faced something similar before. Look, I know my psychiatrist meant well, but wasn't she trivializing my difficulties by saying that I *should* have a different attitude or behavior, or by pointing out that there's a very simple solution to my problems, and I should just have the guts and face them? It's like she was asking: why isn't there more *fight* in me? Well, I think it's pretty obvious. Am I overthinking stuff, and in fact she was perfectly reasonable in her advice? You guys can be honest with me, really.",t2_c63stnk3,False,,0,False,Bad advices for depression?,[],r/depression,False,,,0,,False,t3_12n5fjh,False,dark,0.76,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1681569810.0,text,,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, first things first, let me try to sum things up real quick:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been diagnosed with depression 12 years ago and I&amp;#39;ve been treating it ever since. Even though I wasn&amp;#39;t diagnosed back then, I can trace my first signs of depression to about 18 years ago. I&amp;#39;m 37 years old right now, so I&amp;#39;ve been struggling with this for almost half of my life, and almost my entire adult life. I go to therapy and I consult with a psychiatrist, who has me on medications. I&amp;#39;ve taken multiple types of antidepressants throughout the years, and even though I&amp;#39;m more or less &amp;quot;stable&amp;quot; right now, I&amp;#39;d say it&amp;#39;s far from ideal. I still feel depressed daily, with serious harm to my self esteem and social life. The fight is far from over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now on to what I wanted to talk to you about: recently I had a session with my psychiatrist, but a lot of what she said was really hurtful and it&amp;#39;s been gnawing at me ever since. I&amp;#39;ve been consulting with her for a little over a year. Sadly I&amp;#39;ve been through a lot of different psychiatrists over the years, finding it very hard to 100% trust and rely on someone. I want to know if I&amp;#39;m on the wrong here, or if there&amp;#39;s really some lack of empathy or understanding on her part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, after relaying all my recent struggles, the very first thing she said was to compare me with a child who has difficulty fitting in at school. She literally said something along these lines. I found it very belittling and humiliating. Look, I understand the point of analogies or metaphors, but of all the comparisons that could be made, I feel like something was implied with this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, a lot of the difficulties I&amp;#39;m facing at the moment concern my current job. I find that I&amp;#39;m not valued enough in the team and overall I feel a lack of motivation. The tasks that are given to me make me feel as if I were only an intern, even though that&amp;#39;s not the case. Her response to this was to say that I&amp;#39;m behaving like an intern, and that if I want to be regarded as an equal, I should behave or treat them as one. Look, I can appreciate that this might be some solid advice, but we should not forget that I do suffer from depression and that I have a severely low self-esteem. There&amp;#39;s something about what she said that sounds to me like a variation of &amp;quot;just do it like this&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;you should behave like that&amp;quot;. I can&amp;#39;t quite put my finger on it, but I find it very &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; unhelpful. By making something that I find very hard sound like there&amp;#39;s an easy solution for it, that in turn makes me feel even more stupid for having this difficulty in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, I&amp;#39;m back living with my family right now and I barely ever leave my home. My younger brother lives here as well (even though he&amp;#39;s out most of the time), but we have little in common and we are far from being friends.

Alright, maybe I should, but I really don&amp;#39;t want to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m on the wrong here. Am I seriously mistaken for being stubborn and not making these efforts? As far as I can see, I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; know what things I want, what things I don&amp;#39;t want, and which are my personal limitations and which are my strengths.

&lt;p&gt;I couldn’t sleep last night . I end up finally sleeping then waking up across my bed for some reason above my covers , &amp;amp; when I wake up I search how to slit my wrists on Google??? I literally don’t know why and nothing triggered that. I can’t stop thinking about it . Another day I wake up and imagine myself jumping out the upstairs window for at least an hour . Fantasising about it . But I’d never do that . But part of me wants to but not to die but why don’t I want to die it’s like there’s some
Hope left in me . &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I can’t do that to my family right? But I’m scared one day everything is gonna get too much. Bubble over you know ? I’m 18 but the thought of 9-5 which will 9/10 be something I’m miserable in, full of stress and people who treat you badly makes me not to even want to stay alive to experience it . &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This life is hell, I don’t understand why things are so horrible. So many bad things in this world so much crime, so many mean people, hateful people. No care at all. There’s no joy I don’t understand what people live for , I genuinely don’t . There’s nothing good&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"TW: depression


So right off the bat... I'm clinically diagnosed. Tbh, I was actually feeling better last year, went on months for not having any episodes or breakdowns. However, I was applying to one life insurance offer when I *honestly* wrote I am clinically diagnosed, which was okay with my advisor at first. I just had to answer a questionnaire file. So I did and submitted it. The following day I was asked to have a recent medical check up re my illness. So I did and submitted it. A few weeks later, they wanted an official something regarding my illness, which requires me to undergo multiple tests, therefore, needing so much money.

But
Money wasn't the issue. I got tired and though they literally didnt say anything, it felt like no matter how I currently feel or how I make an effort on being a better person, I am branded for life as a depressed one. So until today, I suffering from it again.

I wasn't really from an abusive family, but they had my favorites among us 3 siblings. I wasn't  a favorite of any of my parent. I was fed and had all my needs taken care of... But there was not much love. I feel like an asshole for still feeling not loved even when I did not struggle growing up but it's just how I felt and I'd like to think I overreacted.

I wasn't really chubby/fat. I was not thin before taking meds too. I was just right and everyone liked my body. Last yr during my mom's birthday party, my aunts kept on calling me fat and kept on telling me to be slimmer, etc. I cried for 2 hours and I was called a killjoy. What hurt mw most was no one really consoled me at that moment. Everyone proceeded on eating while tears were falling from my eyes. I wanted to leave but I was already called a kj, i didnt want to be an AH.

Recently, we went overseas for vacation and my brother kept on pushing me during picture takings while saying ""I don't like you."" And not including me in our family pics. Tho I know it was a joke but, the push really hurt me or idk im overreacting again. Tho i didnt cry at that time, but it made me sad til now.

Yesterday, I had a dilemma at work. It was something related to company policy that my supervisor broke and made a promise to a client which involved me. Idk what to do, he's my supervisor at the same time I dont want to do it. It will cause a lot of conflicts. Now I cant even enjoy my day offs because I keep thinking about it. Huge part of me wishing something would happen to me so I won't get back to work on Monday for his task. 

Today... I blew off the plan my boyfriend had for us. He called off from workfor us but I just felt so tired. I don't want to think too much, I just want any available solution. There was a problem with his plan, he sent me bunched of explanation and at that moment I just didnt want to think or find a solution so I told him I don't want to go since it seemed like he wasnt making any solutions.

I also deleted it from my notifs because I'm scared of what he would say.



Usually, I would have full cries. But right now, it's like I also gave up on crying so... That's why I'm posting here cause idk everything feels heavy and I'm going to work soon... I wish I wouldn't wake up.

&lt;p&gt;So right off the bat... I&amp;#39;m clinically diagnosed. Tbh, I was actually feeling better last year, went on months for not having any episodes or breakdowns. However, I was applying to one life insurance offer when I &lt;em&gt;honestly&lt;/em&gt; wrote I am clinically diagnosed, which was okay with my advisor at first. I just had to answer a questionnaire file. So I did and submitted it. The following day I was asked to have a recent medical check up re my illness. So I did and submitted it. A few weeks later, they wanted an official something regarding my illness, which requires me to undergo multiple tests, therefore, needing so much money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But
Money wasn&amp;#39;t the issue. I got tired and though they literally didnt say anything, it felt like no matter how I currently feel or how I make an effort on being a better person, I am branded for life as a depressed one. So until today, I suffering from it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t really from an abusive family, but they had my favorites among us 3 siblings. I wasn&amp;#39;t  a favorite of any of my parent. I was fed and had all my needs taken care of... But there was not much love. I feel like an asshole for still feeling not loved even when I did not struggle growing up but it&amp;#39;s just how I felt and I&amp;#39;d like to think I overreacted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;#39;t really chubby/fat. I was not thin before taking meds too. I was just right and everyone liked my body. Last yr during my mom&amp;#39;s birthday party, my aunts kept on calling me fat and kept on telling me to be slimmer, etc. I cried for 2 hours and I was called a killjoy. What hurt mw most was no one really consoled me at that moment. Everyone proceeded on eating while tears were falling from my eyes. I wanted to leave but I was already called a kj, i didnt want to be an AH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, we went overseas for vacation and my brother kept on pushing me during picture takings while saying &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t like you.&amp;quot; And not including me in our family pics. Tho I know it was a joke but, the push really hurt me or idk im overreacting again. Tho i didnt cry at that time, but it made me sad til now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I had a dilemma at work. It was something related to company policy that my supervisor broke and made a promise to a client which involved me. Idk what to do, he&amp;#39;s my supervisor at the same time I dont want to do it. It will cause a lot of conflicts. Now I cant even enjoy my day offs because I keep thinking about it. Huge part of me wishing something would happen to me so I won&amp;#39;t get back to work on Monday for his task. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today... I blew off the plan my boyfriend had for us. He called off from workfor us but I just felt so tired. I don&amp;#39;t want to think too much, I just want any available solution. There was a problem with his plan, he sent me bunched of explanation and at that moment I just didnt want to think or find a solution so I told him I don&amp;#39;t want to go since it seemed like he wasnt making any solutions. We didnt talk for hours. I said sorry after feeling a tiny bit lighter. We talked for a while, not fighting. Last message I sent him was if his available tonight, I still wanted to talk since everything&amp;#39;s blowing up my mind and heart. But he didn&amp;#39;t read it for an hour.

,depression," I guess you could say I'm an asshole. I stopped caring about being polite and nice a decade ago when I finally realized it doesn't matter if you're a good person, especially when you're surrounded by assholes who just take you for granted, like my dad, my shithead sister, every horrible stepfamily and every horrible friend I've been stupid enough to have. It's like being around assholes fermented me into becoming one myself, and I hate it.

 I really wish life were different. I wish all the work I put into making my life better mattered. I wish I could just get a job at Target and suddenly all my student debt for a Graphic Design degree I'm too poor to use would disappear and I could get my license and my car back and finally find a woman to settle down with and finally raise a family and be the dad I never had. I stopped believing in God a long time ago, but when I'm really desperate and down, I find myself praying again to any god that will listen.

 My dreams of being an actor have been burned to ash. I'm in my early thirties now and I had to move back across the country from California (because poor). I had a few background acting jobs, but they pay minimum wage and the jobs are few and far between. By the time I'm finally ready to try acting again, I'll be in my forties and I'm not so sure I want to keep trying that route of artistic endeavor, to be honest. Movies suck these days, I'd be better off making indie films. 

 I stopped exercising four years ago after I lost my car, I didn't see the point anymore. My bicep ripped when I was at my desk and flexed my wrist, just my body casually tearing itself to shreds, the shit icing to the ass cake of my life. I can't afford surgery so I've got to walk around with the belly of the muscle in my armpit until I can finally afford it. I'm so mad.

 I have to borrow wifi from a friend of mine. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. It's a real pain to get any work done.

 I'm trying to get my latest novel published. My mom says it's my best work yet. I've been rejected 120 times by agents and publishers even though they all tell me my work is good. Personally, I think it's because one of my characters is a nationalist and the grand majority of agents and publishers today are liberal. So publishing a good old fashioned traditional story about damsels in distress and knights slaying dragons isn't going to happen. (I really think the world wants to see some of the classic magic that made readers and viewers feel good when the story was over. I know I sure do after all I've been through.) I've tried self-publishing before. Problem is, everyone is self-publishing and there isn't really a market on Amazon for specific books, so there's a flood of stories and it's insanely hard to stand out. Best bet, according to me, was to traditionally publish, but I told you how that's going.

 I tried asking millionaires like Mr. Beast, JK Rowling and Andrew Tate to patron my work. Of all the people I wrote, Andrew Tate wrote me back. We talked for 6 hours about my work before he told me he wasn't interested and asked if I would buy his hustlers class. I told him I can't afford it, he said ""What about 50 bucks?"" and I said ""Tell you what, you patron my book and then I'll DEFINITELY have 50 bucks."" He took acceptation to that, so I left him with ""look man, a celebrity endorsement is one thing, but a convicted celebrity will make a shitty book fly off the shelves like hotcakes. My writing isn't even shitty, it's epic. My books will sell and stay sold, and I'm guessing you could use the money about as much as I can right now. I won't beg, but it'd be foolish not to take me on, especially if it kept you talking to me about it for 6 hours.""

 I woke up angry this morning, in the same shitty apartment, in the same horrible neighborhood I've been living in for 10 years that I wished I'd never have to see again the first time I moved out. I miss my car, I miss the freedom I had, I miss traveling for the first time in forever in my mid twenties, only to have it all taken away in the blink of an eye. Really put into perspective how fragile everything is. I miss the beach. I specifically miss the tall curvy blonde I was talking to the last time I had abs but I was too shy to seal the deal and thought she was out of my league. I haven't met a woman willing to suffer with me, anyway, but I'm not going to cry about ""what is love?"" like an emo kid in high school.

I did, however, punch another hole in the wall and screamed at the top of my lungs, after expressing to my mother, a day before, that I don't know why I bother restraining myself. No one gave me the time of day when I was polite and nice and life didn't suck any less than it does now. I scared my poor cat though, I gave him treats and pets and cuddles to let him know I wasn't mad at him. Poor kitty. Did I mention I miss my car? I can't even afford the bus to volunteer at the SPCA I used to go to where I got him from.

It doesn't help that I'm a cis straight white male, these days anyway. Say what you will, but there's bias towards me for some reason. I see it everywhere whenever I'm trying to get hired or publish my art (literary and illustrated.) Apparently black authors can submit unsolicited work, but everyone else needs an agent.

,depression,"I don’t know if this is the appropriate place to post this but I don’t know where else to.

I often forget people have furniture.  Dressers, couches, dining tables, etc.

This is a consequence of poverty, moving across state lines every goddamn year, and indifference.  The TV which we rarely use (and is only used by my partner) is resting on a cardboard box.

The only furniture pieces we own (if you don’t count a mattress and computer chairs) are two computer desks.

I know that’s more than many people have.  I know homeless people don’t have a mattress.  I know I should just shut up and be grateful for what I have.

I miss having a dresser.  I miss having a bed.

Im the classic “saver vs spender” debate I am the saver and she is the spender.  As I sit at my desk, with one budget monitor, I look over at theirs.  I see a Macbook, two monitors (one of which is a widescreen), a boom mic, a VR headset, a massive merch collection hanging from the wall, and an old Ipad used to monitor the camera all day.  In the bedroom is a second, newer tablet next to their high end, newer phone.

Obviously these were all gathered over the years.  It’s not like they were purchased all at once.

I miss having a nightstand with a drawer.  It was nice.  But now I don’t really have anything to put there.  Most of my belongings are in bags in the closet.  Things I cannot use in daily life yet are too important to dispose.

Upstairs, the neighbors are fighting.  I always live next to someone fun.  It’s the curse of living in low-income housing but I can’t afford otherwise.

I tried to kill myself last week and the only person I’ve told lives on another continent and my partner doesn’t know they exist.  I failed not because of cowardice, but because the method wouldn’t work no matter how much I tried.  I am probably going to try again soon with another method…just because the urge is strengthened by my failure, not weakened.

Just before I tried it, I contemplated my life up to that point, if I would be okay doing it, if I’d be okay with having achieved everything at this point in my life and nothing more.  And I was.  It wasn’t a difficult decision.

The scars on my body prove I’m not above doing horrible things to myself.

I have been a prisoner to so many things for so long.  I don’t see an escape.  I honestly don’t.  I am a prisoner to so, so many things.

I only left the apartment alone once in two and a half years and it was because my partner had an emergency while they were out.  Otherwise, they either want to come with when I go out “because it’s a chance to get out of the house” or “they like doing things together.”  Otherwise, they don’t like it.  Why?

Covid.  It’s the reason I haven’t been allowed to work for three years.  They don’t want me to catch it and bring it into the house and make them sick.  They are terrified of dying.  Despite this, they haven’t been to a doctor in almost 25 years.  When I point out this incongruence, their response is, word of word, “I don’t want to be poked and prodded and told I’m fat.”

I have a medical condition that made working dangerous for a few years.  I worked through it which was a very dangerous thing, but even now with it under control, it is a monster, hiding in my body, ready to attack me at any second and take control.  I know my sense of security is false.  I’m not cured.  I’m temporarily patched.  People have recurrences after five, ten years.  I’m at four and love the sense of feeling normal, even if my meds have some legitimacy shitty side effects.


The kind of person I am is the “enemy of the day” in right-wing circles and I am terrified to step outside because of it.  My weight makes me not want to go outside anyway.  I can feel the eyes of everyone upon me for my size, even if I’m not super large by American standards I still feel hideous.  These two things further make me a prisoner.

My father hit me and did some pretty fucked up things I won’t repeat.  My mother did some too but she was also very nurturing and loving.  But she never taught me how to say no.  She said it was rude and I should be helpful to everyone no matter what, and to always put others before me.

Always.

This lead to me literally seeing myself essentially as a robot meant to serve others.  As I’ve gotten older, it has lead to me being exploited by others.  But remember, everyone is more important than you at all times.

My mom has since apologized and stated she wishes she taught me a little differently, or at least communicated a little better what she meant.

It has turned me into an unwilling slave to others.  It is easier to make myself miserable serving than and giving them anything and fulfilling every demand than it is to go through the conversation where I say no.  Because they say why they need me, and I can’t fight it.

I can’t fight others.  My mother said as soon as I raise a finger against a bully I’m just as bad as them, and both of my parents instilled great fear of my father.  He will not be questioned or corrected, even if wrong.  Or else the yelling, the degrading, the violence starts.

This is why I can’t handle my emotions.  My father taught me emotions are a choice.  At night I would shiver and shake and rest against my wall, repeating his words in my mind.  “You’re just mad because you know I’m right.”

No.  It’s because I was upset about being screamed at in my face.  When I see yelling in his style in videos, that posture, it makes me so afraid.

And so I’d shake in my bed, curled up, leaning on the wall, shaming myself for having emotions yet thinking “I’ll show them one day.”

I think my mother silently sobbing as she cleaned my blood from the kitchen floor counts, not through direct violence, but evidence of “this is where my life has lead me.”

I used to have meltdowns where I’d scream.  Sometimes destroy things.  I did this in school.  It was a box, a safe box where I could unleash hell and emotionally release yet not be beat by the teachers.  The principal of the elementary school was scared of me.

All of this, plus so much more, has lead me to this point.  The point where I tie a cable around my neck but no matter how hard I squeeze, it doesn’t cut off the main artery or stop my breathing.

It’s not a matter of “you don’t want to die, you just want the pain to stop.”

No.  It’s not about “just wanting pain to stop.”

&lt;p&gt;My mom has since apologized and stated she wishes she taught me a little differently, or at least communicated a little better what she meant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has turned me into an unwilling slave to others.  It is easier to make myself miserable serving than and giving them anything and fulfilling every demand than it is to go through the conversation where I say no.  Because they say why they need me, and I can’t fight it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t fight others.  My mother said as soon as I raise a finger against a bully I’m just as bad as them, and both of my parents instilled great fear of my father.  He will not be questioned or corrected, even if wrong.  Or else the yelling, the degrading, the violence starts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I can’t handle my emotions.  My father taught me emotions are a choice.  At night I would shiver and shake and rest against my wall, repeating his words in my mind.  “You’re just mad because you know I’m right.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.  It’s because I was upset about being screamed at in my face.  When I see yelling in his style in videos, that posture, it makes me so afraid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so I’d shake in my bed, curled up, leaning on the wall, shaming myself for having emotions yet thinking “I’ll show them one day.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think my mother silently sobbing as she cleaned my blood from the kitchen floor counts, not through direct violence, but evidence of “this is where my life has lead me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to have meltdowns where I’d scream.  Sometimes destroy things.  I did this in school.  It was a box, a safe box where I could unleash hell and emotionally release yet not be beat by the teachers.  The principal of the elementary school was scared of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this, plus so much more, has lead me to this point.  The point where I tie a cable around my neck but no matter how hard I squeeze, it doesn’t cut off the main artery or stop my breathing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not a matter of “you don’t want to die, you just want the pain to stop.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.  It’s not about “just wanting pain to stop.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This life is intrinsically flawed.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ve had depression for as long as I can remember, but it has recently gotten really bad. Over the past few months, I’ve struggled to even get out of bed, let alone bathe, work, etc.

I told my psychiatrist that one of my biggest fears is that I’ll lose my friends. He told me this is irrational.

Today, my biggest fear finally happened. My friends all got together for one of their birthdays and I wasn’t invited. I can’t blame them at all! But it still hurts. 

How do I move forward? I care about these relationships. In this case, I feel like explaining to my friend what’s been going on will make her feel guilty and put the onus on her for not inviting me to her birthday. I don’t want to make her feel that way at all!

,depression,"I just wanna vent.   


I will never be able to wrap my head around the fact, that some people are so blessed in every single way, while others are suffering so much. I know that everyone goes trough tough times (heartbreak, fights, rejection etc.), but some people have to face so many hardships - especially at such a young age, while others don't have to deal with any really traumatic hardships.

,depression,"I can't even function. Over the last month I've been missing days of work, not going to class or studying, avoiding doing things so that now I'm in debt and I might lose my drivers license which means I won't be able to work and everything is falling apart. I feel like I'm losing my mind. Twice in the last week, I have completely lost control of myself and just sobbed and hit myself and banged on the floor. I have bruises on my hands and legs now because of it, and I'm afraid to go to work because I don't want to lose control like that in a public place. I'm afraid of myself because I'm unpredictable, even to me. 

I've been struggling with clinical depression since I was 13, and I tried antidepressants once when I was 19 but quit after a while because they made me not feel anything at all. But at this point I literally cannot function. I don't feel like I have a choice. As much as I want to feel alive and feel the variety of life, I do remember how much easier it was to just exist when I took medication. I remember feeling clarity for the first time, like all the fuzziness and noise in my head was just gone. I remember slowly getting off of them and being really shocked at how just how *loud* my head was getting and how it made it so much harder to do things, just normal every day things like go the store and make breakfast and text a friend. 

I haven't had a depressive episode in years (probably since I tried meds the first time), but I have too much to lose at this point, too much I'm responsible for. And the time between episodes is getting shorter. I guess I'm getting worse, even though I'm more in control of my life than ever and for once actually know what I'm doing with my life. There are things now that I want to do and accomplish and I'm ruining it for myself and I feel so completely out of control. So I decided that in order to be a better partner, sister, daughter, friend - something needs to change. I simply cannot live like this anymore. Despite the side effects (there were plenty others that I didn't like), I'm willing this time around to try as many different medications as it takes and actually take back control of my life. I really feel like I've tried everything else out there. 

And I'm really shocked that my boyfriend said that it's a cop-out. That I'm just giving up. That he misses the old me. That if I just followed his advice and thought more positively I would feel better, that I should grit my teeth and bear it and figure it out for myself. I can't even describe how hurtful it was to hear that. I don't even know how to act around him now, I don't feel like I can be myself with him and I feel like he's a stranger. Our relationship is suffering because of my mental health but he's going to think less of me because I'm treating my mental health? What the actual fuck. So now on top of everything else, I can add to the list losing one of the most important people in my life because I'm a broken mess who can't get their shit together and having to shove everything down and hide everything in my own goddamn house. It just feels awful because he said out loud things that I've been saying to myself, things that have been keeping me from deciding to start meds. I'm still going to see a psychiatrist next week because *I* know that it's not simply a lack of trying.

,depression,"Hi. I'm no stranger to depression and anxiety, I've experienced it since I was young, but now that I've come out of a long depressive numbness, the more I come out the worse I feel.

I won't go into all of the details, but I went through quite a bit growing up, my first anxiety attack was when I was 7. When I was 15 my mother became terminally ill and when I was 17 she passed away in front of me. When she died it was like I went into an auto-pilot, I have no real memories other than spotty moments from those first five years of her being gone. I went to live with my maternal grandparents straight after because my stepfather let me go to their house the night of her death and just never came to get me, he just left me there and the family that was always together all just stopped being around one another.

This year really said, ""You're starting to feel again? Let's give it a go."" Finally got my license in February, car broke down immediately and had to get it fixed, in March my cat who was given to me by my mother got sick and had to have a scan and is now on medication with the vet just slapping ""heart failure"" on it without elaborating if he'll be okay on the medication, and now there's my sibling in April.

I have a sibling who is 10 years younger than me. Throughout these last 8 years, I've tried everything to see them; I would show up for Christmas, Easter, and birthdays, took them Trick or Treating (when they were younger), showed up at their school just to say hi, would randomly ask them to go to the movies or some other event, took them to the Easter show when I was allowed to, talked to them on the phone when I couldn't go see them. It was difficult at times as I would make plans with them then their father would say they were actually doing something at that time so I couldn't go see them, as well as the added barrier of not being able to drive until recently and us living in different towns (even if they are close together they're not a safe walking distance), and the grandparent who took me in having had a fight with their father and not taking me around there because they ""didn't feel welcome."" It's difficult to get there and has only gotten harder as time has gone on; both of us work and they have school on top of that so finding time to see them is hard. I still try all I can, I showed up at their house for Easter even though they weren't there, just to drop off some chocolate. Their dad spoke to me about how they're rebelling a bit, which is to be expected they're a teenager now and their upbringing wouldn't have been pleasant. The things they're doing do worry me but there's worse they could be doing, I hit a very similar phase in my late teens. I spent the first, like, five years after my mother's passing not really registering much, trying to pick up my life in between constantly sleeping to escape. Now that I've become more aware though since a fog has been lifted from my head, having been building up a career and deciding what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, I'm constantly in distress, thinking I should have been there even more than I was, pushed for more time--but the time has passed for that now and all I'm left with is the pain that I could have possibly hurt them by not being there at least every week (time goes so fast, years go so fast). I've been trying hard this last week but I work 8:45 till 5:30 most days and any day I have off they don't think they're free--they're a teen who wants to be with their friends.

It's such a weird feeling, suddenly coming out of a funk and being flooded with so much. I constantly distract myself with anything I can to the point I can't even go make a coffee without taking my laptop with me to listen to a video because being alone with myself hurts.

I don't know why I'm bringing this up here, I just don't know who to talk to I just wanted to get it out there.

Anyway. I can delete this if it doesn't fit the group. I hope everyone else is doing relatively alright, and I wish you all the best.",t2_72lxbc59,False,,0,False,This year is really trying me...

It was difficult at times as I would make plans with them then their father would say they were actually doing something at that time so I couldn&amp;#39;t go see them, as well as the added barrier of not being able to drive until recently and us living in different towns (even if they are close together they&amp;#39;re not a safe walking distance), and the grandparent who took me in having had a fight with their father and not taking me around there because they &amp;quot;didn&amp;#39;t feel welcome.&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s difficult to get there and has only gotten harder as time has gone on; both of us work and they have school on top of that so finding time to see them is hard. I still try all I can, I showed up at their house for Easter even though they weren&amp;#39;t there, just to drop off some chocolate. Their dad spoke to me about how they&amp;#39;re rebelling a bit, which is to be expected they&amp;#39;re a teenager now and their upbringing wouldn&amp;#39;t have been pleasant. The things they&amp;#39;re doing do worry me but there&amp;#39;s worse they could be doing, I hit a very similar phase in my late teens. I spent the first, like, five years after my mother&amp;#39;s passing not really registering much, trying to pick up my life in between constantly sleeping to escape. Now that I&amp;#39;ve become more aware though since a fog has been lifted from my head, having been building up a career and deciding what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, I&amp;#39;m constantly in distress, thinking I should have been there even more than I was, pushed for more time--but the time has passed for that now and all I&amp;#39;m left with is the pain that I could have possibly hurt them by not being there at least every week (time goes so fast, years go so fast). I&amp;#39;ve been trying hard this last week but I work 8:45 till 5:30 most days and any day I have off they don&amp;#39;t think they&amp;#39;re free--they&amp;#39;re a teen who wants to be with their friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s such a weird feeling, suddenly coming out of a funk and being flooded with so much. I constantly distract myself with anything I can to the point I can&amp;#39;t even go make a coffee without taking my laptop with me to listen to a video because being alone with myself hurts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know why I&amp;#39;m bringing this up here, I just don&amp;#39;t know who to talk to I just wanted to get it out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway. I can delete this if it doesn&amp;#39;t fit the group. I hope everyone else is doing relatively alright, and I wish you all the best.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"TW: suicide/self harm

not looking for help/advice, but encouragement would be nice 

today was the last straw. i (17m) have tried so hard in life to be known as the kid who has a future, but i’m only known as a joke and an easy target to everyone.

i don’t take myself seriously, and thats on purpose. people forget that life should be a fun adventure, and that making fun of yourself is part of living. unfortunately, people decided that i can never be taken seriously, so whenever i actually try to do something important or thoughtful, people take as another one of my feeble attempts to make a joke.

the last straw of my motivation to try was today. i applied for a class at my school that focuses on leading the student body through events/community. the leaders were selected today, and just like every other area of my life where i try to get a meaningful role, i was rejected. the person selected did deserve the role and is a good friend of mine, but this experience showed the lack of faith in me that everyone possesses. other roles i have tried to acquire is to be a manager for the schools coffee company that i pour my heart and soul into as well as being recognized for academic achievement, as my school does this yearly. i have never received any of the listed things.

lately i have become the punching bag of everyones stress. my boss changes the procedures and doesn’t tell me just to get me in trouble. people at my school call me stupid, fat, annoying, worthless, and worst of all, unloveable. i have to deal with it. i talk to my parents about my social issues at school, and they say “either avoid them, or don’t let them affect you.” i cant do either of those things. i go to a small school. i have social anxiety, so every word anyone says about me i take seriously.

this past year i started cutting. my parents found out and were angry and ashamed of me. they barely cared. all they want is for me not to ruin their fantasy of their perfect family and perfect life. no one really cared about the pain i was and still am going through. i only stopped to get myself out of therapy. i don’t know how long it will be before i start cutting again, as i don't feel worth anymore.

my parents know i have adhd, but refuse to get me diagnosed and medicated, because i should “just deal with it”. i want to be able to be clear of mind like my peers, but can’t unless they medicate me, but they won’t. they don’t understand how much it affects me everyday, and i can’t tell them because they will just say i am being dramatic.

the only thing keeping me alive is my faith. if it weren’t for God, i would have killed myself earlier in 2022. i am praying that all this will pass and i can be successful and happy one day. that day is not now. i don’t feel motivated to try and prove myself through homework, intelligence, behavior, or work anymore. i don’t know if i will completely give up on life soon, but i can see that reality coming in my future.",t2_99fvlw8jz,False,,0,False,i have lost motivation to live,[],r/depression,False,,,0,,False,t3_12mqebe,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1681534172.0,text,,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;TW: suicide/self harm&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"This seems silly to even post about, but it had a, if not just for a moment, positive impact on me. For a little context, I’m in college and have been struggling for years to finish (physics major is difficult, who would’ve thought?), and I was in the library having a particularly rough time. I was just sitting down and rarely do I ever actually let my deeper sadness show, but it was apparently on full display and I didn’t even know. I was too tired to care about masking it, and my eyes were beginning to well with tears. All the while, I sat silently staring off into nothing. 

Out of the corner of my eye I see a lady kind of approaching, but not quite directly at me. I pay it no mind, and continue staring off. She pauses for a bit and then comes up to me and kind of breaks me out of my trance. She was a slightly older lady I think (I’m 25M for reference), and she came up and just said “Honey, are you okay?” It kind of jump scared me a little because I wasn’t expecting it. I didn’t know how to respond, if I’m being honest. I was at the point of boiling over, and it took so much in me not to break down into a sobbing mess then and there. I told her that I was just a little tired is all. Of course she probably knew I was BSing, but yeah. She asked me my major, talked for a minute longer and ended with a “please take care.”

I wanted to give her a hug so badly. She had no idea just what that did for me. Of course, nothing can fully alleviate these feelings, but that gave me a brief reprieve if only for a little while.

,depression,"I (22f) have been going through an extremely rough patch recently. My medication has stopped working for me, I can’t afford housing in my state and the family I live with are extremely verbally abusive and manipulative.
Around 3 weeks ago I ended up homeless for over a week due to a very vile argument with said family, and I had to couch surf for a while to have somewhere safe to sleep. During this time I was struggling severely with even continuing forward because it felt like everything around me was falling apart. One of the places I stayed at during this time was my (at the time) gf’s, but I ended up only staying one night because she didn’t want me to stay another. That weekend I ended up on my dad’s couch for the first time ever. The next morning I woke up to a breakup text from my gf. She explained that the relationship wasn’t worth the effort to her, along with other more personal things that I won’t get into.
Within a week after this all happening, other friends (some mutual) stopped responding or even opening my texts. 
I know I’ve been a lot lately and things have been really hard, but it feels like everyone only wants me around when they need me and the second I need them they want nothing to do with me. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong anymore. I mean when someone you care about is struggling aren’t you supposed to at least assure them that you’re still there? That you still fucking care about them? If you love someone aren’t you supposed to fucking show that instead of dropping them the moment they start to struggle?

,depression,"\[MtF\] The medication 'Seroquel' seemed to be the only thing that 'cured' it (October, 2022). And to be honest, it made me feel like a superhero at times, haha; I mean, for the first time, it felt like my brain was actually functioning the way it was supposed to. The world was vibrant and exciting, and my thoughts were rapid and clear. Sure, I was a bit eccentric on it, but I've always been.

Having said that, I developed alopecia that I believe was the result of this medication (or a combination—and further Googling seems to reinforce that). They switched me over to 'Risperidone' because I was still 'too hyper'. Then, to a combination of 'Seroquel' and 'Abilify', which is when I started shedding my hair significantly. Since then (December, 2022), I dropped it only on estradiol. It's hard to say what the specific cause was, exactly.

Then my sister died and I was just fucking alone, and I ended up trying to go to the pub where this girl worked because I had no one else, but it felt so unfair, so instead I just went in there and ignored her for some fucking reason.

Then I started running into her at the gym, but we kept ignoring each other. Eventually I tried to explain it over text, but I fucked that up too, and she didn’t reply.

,depression," 

I will start of by saying that I may or may not be suffering from depression. Ever since I turned 16 I started feeling jelous towards my peers: profesionally, academically, relationship wise. 

Everytime I try to share these emotions with someone, namely my mother she just brushed them off and made no big deal out of them. Telling me to just ""man up"" basically. When I shared them with friends they either said nothing or told me to get over it.. as such I bottle these feelings because it seems to be a nuisance to other people. Fucking assholes.

I feel envy profesionally because I do not work in the places I wish to work and for positions I want to work at. I am underpaid, working a job I have grown out of for years.

Relationship wise, I barely have any friends anymore after college. No partners due to me not taking the initiative to do so. Not due to lack of confidence but due to constant daydreaming and fantasizing about being in a relationship instead of actually pursuing it.

I do not feel like an independent person, up till recently I was living with my parents and just now am learning to live on my own. I wanted this to be sooner but due to my own lack of initiative and financial struggles I was not able to.

I have been addicted to pornography and videogames ever since I was a teen. Just now I am trying to fix these issues. But its hard man... really hard after 15 years of constant use. Makes me feel disgusting. Full of hatred. But at any inconvinience or struggle, I immediately resort to these two things.

Lately I have been suffering from mood swings from manic anger and anxiety to relative peace serenity and reflection. Within the same hour even. I have also seemed to garner small panic attacks at the most ridiculous and inconsequential things that happen to me.

I talk to myself. Alot. Alot alot over the years. For about a couple years now this self talk has turnt more negative over time. Insulting my own capability and intelligence at any mistake.

There have also been times...in which I contemplated suicide... but not seriously. Just the idea of ending it all has crossed my mind.

Nevertheless my life has started to feel worthless (not in a sad way, more as a daily basis). To give some context: I am a trans women in the beginning of my 20’s i a good private college with good privileges in a country where they are not common.

With all that and with the “knowledge” that my life is good as it is, since a long time I’ve developed a weird sense of nothingness as a whole. I do not have fiends, not really, at least I can say the have better friends. Also the seemed to have to developed a “good” life: job, partner, stability.

And there it is me, I have accomplished almost nothing and my life has become stagnant. Is not the same old issue of: “oh lord I have not partner I am not lovable and I am worthless because of that” is more like: well I don’t have any objective to go to, not really. And I kinda have developed this rare state of mind where my life pauses waiting for others (but other’s lifes go on, as expected) so I end in a weird spot of nothingness.

I do not know if that is depression, or a normal step of my life, but with fine has became more uncomfortable the notion of: I am staying in my bed crying all night feeling miserable for nothing, others have started their lifes.

No, this is not a generic non sense most people vauch for or advise to get better but a realistic way to deal with shit.

- Write it down ! Task? Thought? Anger? Throw it on to the paper and let it be. It may not solve anything but will definately give you clarity on your current issues.

-Do the bare minimum. Break down every task to small doable task and go for it. Don't forget to tick it off your list.

-Everytime any bad thoughts comes to your mind. DONT ACT. Just take a deep breath and calmly make a note of it. Half the time it's just uncertainty. Nothing else.

-Be open to medicines but don't challenge it. Give it some time and try different combinations. Some work like charm. But try.

-Last but not the least, take a moment to appreciate how far you have come. You are stronger than you think. This phase is temporary and making you think it's not worth it.

I know these thoughts are not who I am; they’re not true, and they won’t last. Even so; it still feels as if they’re sucking all of my cognitive functions, my creativity, my personality, my memories, my joy, my empathy, my sense of gratitude, my motivation, my patience. It sometimes feels as if who I love to be, will never return. These intrusive thoughts are so constant. It’s been weeks. It’s almost been months. I hadn’t felt like this since my prepubescent early teens when I expected my  hormones to be irregular and underdevelopment. 
It’s been so hard to cry. I finally was able to let these silent, big tears roll down my cheeks for the first time in a while. It was during my moon cycle, and my boyfriend hadn’t called me back, and I took that as a clear indication that he must not love me as much as I love him. That no one loves me as much as I love them. I was so excited about turning 30 this year. My already 30+yo friends said it was such a great time in your life; you know who you are, what you want. Things are supposed to be so clear, and better. I had so much excitement, so much expectation. My Mom had told me that I had not accomplished enough before becoming this age. Criticizing me that she had some unspoken expectation that I would have done more with my life by now.. that I had nothing to be happy or excited about. I had no idea she thought of me in this way, that she could have been disappointed in me. It crushed me. 
I had plans of going on a huge cruise trip with my friends and family and making an amazing time of it for my 30th. She said she and my family  could not (or would rather not) go. The friends that wanted to come either can’t afford, or taking time to go; or they don’t get along with other friends that I planned to invite. 
I don’t think I even want a party. I don’t know if I want to plan to get all these so called friends together and try to make everyone have a great time. I’m tired of feeling so responsible for everyone around me. I don’t want to care anymore. I rather drive off somewhere by myself, and toy with the idea of staying wherever I end up.
I can’t stop thinking about these so called friends that I currently have in my life. My luck with certain friends have been hit or miss. I can feel my age with how quickly and often I’ve been growing out of friendships and situations. It makes me feel like it’s my fault, and I’ve done something wrong. The familiar feeling like I’m slowly been abandoned by everyone I’ve ever known. I’m returning to work after almost 8 months recovering from a heel fracture. I had gained weight since I couldn’t do any of my exercises; this is the heaviest I’ve ever been. The lack of exercise and weight gain has made my social anxiety so much worse. It’s frustrating not being able to feel as strong or flexible as you know you could be. My confidence feels very low. So many thoughts of being compared to and by other family members that are hardly involved in my life. It’s sad; I thought that side of my family was so much more understanding than how they really are. So judgmental, shallow, superficial, just waiting to throw you under the bus. 
It wasn’t a very present love, and there was hardly ever any support. It felt like a club that me or my immediate family would never be apart of.

I had plans of going on a huge cruise trip with my friends and family and making an amazing time of it for my 30th. She said she and my family  could not (or would rather not) go. The friends that wanted to come either can’t afford, or taking time to go; or they don’t get along with other friends that I planned to invite. 
I don’t think I even want a party. I don’t know if I want to plan to get all these so called friends together and try to make everyone have a great time. I’m tired of feeling so responsible for everyone around me. I don’t want to care anymore. I rather drive off somewhere by myself, and toy with the idea of staying wherever I end up.
I can’t stop thinking about these so called friends that I currently have in my life. My luck with certain friends have been hit or miss. I can feel my age with how quickly and often I’ve been growing out of friendships and situations. It makes me feel like it’s my fault, and I’ve done something wrong. The familiar feeling like I’m slowly been abandoned by everyone I’ve ever known. I’m returning to work after almost 8 months recovering from a heel fracture. I had gained weight since I couldn’t do any of my exercises; this is the heaviest I’ve ever been. The lack of exercise and weight gain has made my social anxiety so much worse. It’s frustrating not being able to feel as strong or flexible as you know you could be. My confidence feels very low. So many thoughts of being compared to and by other family members that are hardly involved in my life. It’s sad; I thought that side of my family was so much more understanding than how they really are. So judgmental, shallow, superficial, just waiting to throw you under the bus. 
It wasn’t a very present love, and there was hardly ever any support. It felt like a club that me or my immediate family would never be apart of. 
I still felt my heart break, learning of these new realities.
 There’s so much more that I want to write about. I’m not looking for advice, but I hope maybe this will help someone reading this know they they’re not alone, and this is a safe space.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hi I'm 16yo male from Germany and until about a year ago I had a thriving friend group, friends everywhere and a person I had intercourse with sometimes. I had friends I cuddled with on the regular and I got hugs from lots of people everyday. There was an Incident that split my friendgroup and because basically everyone I knew, knew these people I was mostly alone for a few months I had my parents but I was never really emotionally close with them and tell them nofhingabout my feelings because it just doesn't feel right. I still had my male best friend who I love(platonically). I've known him forever and he's really just the best, but like in a lot of male friendships we don't talk about our feelings. As I said before I had lots of people I could talk to but after the split there wasn't anybody really. I had a girlfriend for a few months who I cried to about every time we were together longer than a few hours but I'm not with her anymore because she didn't want me anymore and I really noticed that she's just an attention craving asshole. So since a few months I haven't told anybody about how I feel, I had an emotional breakdown which my parents cared for me(which I hated, when I cried to one of my friends earlier it was really relieving and took emotional balast of me but with my parents I just hate it). So I have a new friendgroup now and there's lots of guys and a few girls who are all great people but I just don't have a person to touch(non sexually). Sometimes I just feel like nobody wants me and I have a lot of suicidal thoughts, although I think I wouldn't actually kill myself I'm too rational for that. The only human touch I get rn is dapping up friends hugs from my family which just feel like mandatory and maybe a hug every few days from one of the girls in my new friendgroup. I really crave human touch and just want to cry to somebody I just want someone to understand me but nobody ever asks how I really feel and as of rn I have nobody to open up to. I really just want to hug someone for a long long time or maybe sleep in with someone in my arms someone who trusts me, but that just seems so farfetched. Also I have a lot of emotional swings, on some days I could just dance around my town alone with music cuz I'm happy and on others I feel like I want to die eventhough I'm with my best friends.

I’m on vacation in the Caribbean. I’m in paradise. My depression is in remission (see “for context” section at the end of this post).

I had a great day and settled down for the night and like clockwork, around 830pm (when I normally take my antidepressant) I  feel those familiar pangs of sadness—that biological reminder that no matter what I do, that stupid depression “demon” will always be on my back.

I take my meds and the feeling goes away. I normally take my meds before this happens but once in a while I’m a little late. 30 minutes late and it’s gnawing at me. Not exaggerating. The sadness is a gnawing feeling of dread in my gut.

I am so fortunate (seriously, see “for context” section). I found something that worked for me. 

For those struggling—there is hope for you. Everyone is different but as a lifelong sufferer (until the age of 19) I can tell you that the darkness can end. It wants you to believe it can’t. That’s where its power is—depression is so fucking convincing. 

I’ve been through hell. I’ve been at the bottom and then had the bottom plunge further down, again and again. I know what it is like. It is hell but know this…

If you’ve made it 10 seconds or 10 days, each moment you’ve endured this suffering has made you stronger. Depression may try to convince you that you are weak, bad, undeserving. That life isn’t worth living. It is so good at this. But it is not you thinking those thoughts. It is the thing that wants to destroy you.

KEEP FIGHTING! You are stronger than you know and there is hope for you, even if you can’t see it. The hope is there. 

For context—I have treatment resistant major depressive disorder that has been in remission for 20 years now thanks to the meds I’m on. I’m 39. My earliest memories (at 5-ish years old) are of realizing that something wasn’t right. I believe I was born with MDD. During my teens I took over 30 different psychiatric drugs to try to cure what I call “the demon”. Nothing worked. I took Lexapro for a week and a half and when the doc upped my dose, it literally cured me (except for exhaustion—which Adderall fixed). 

I was standing in line for coffee at a cafe and was bracing myself for this onslaught of sadness that was building inside me. The sadness was swinging like a pendulum inside me. It moved forward and then just vanished. I was standing in line when I experienced my first moment as depression free. It was like breathing fresh air for the first time. 

I was hospitalized in my teens and missed my senior year of high school due to depression. MDD made it impossible to get out of bed, to take a shower, even to write a sentence on a homework worksheet. I was incredibly ill and beat it. I graduated college with distinction and have done well in my career field. I even got married and became a foster parent. 

I’m not all that extraordinary. I just your average person. I want to shake your shoulders hard and hug you and tell you that we are the same. I was so far gone and made it through. If I can beat it, I swear, you can too. 

And your “cure” may be different. I know Lexapro doesn’t work for everyone. Brain chemistry is different for everyone. But my god, I found something that worked after 30+ med trials. PLEASE, PLEASE keep going.

Everyday feels like being trapped in a cage, in a world where there is no joy, no escape. I stopped feeling pleasure from anything, my self esteem goes down every single day, I have nothing to do besides mindless activities, nothing interests me and I have a feeling that everyone is better than me.
Im bad at every job I applied to, even though I put in the work. I feel as if I'm not as intelligent as my peers, I didn't finish high school (I go to classes on weekends to actually have one finished) I never did well at school and I have a pathological family. At 19, i rented a small apartment to live with my girlfriend I worked full time as a storage worker at a warehouse that is a company of my girlfriends father. The job wasn't bad, but not very legal. I stopped working there since I got into an argument about my paycheck with my boss and I was tired of their ""we're rich"" attitude. I found a job at a convenience store just before I quit. And started working there to pay the bills. The workload is too much, everyday i do something not the right way and I've never lived in so much stress. I'm self doubting myself because I seem to not be capable of something as simple as working at a convienience store, my pay drops and drops, my girlfriend can't help me and is mad that I cannot keep a job and actually do It well, even though she is supportive. I see my friends once a month for three hours, every single one of them is at least satisfied to a degree with their life. I feel alone, no one understands me and I'm getting more depressed every day. There is nothing that bring me joy, I view the world as a trap and a dystopia. I don't understand how others can be happy, I want to be like them but I do not know how. I made a living for myself, yes, but every day is a depressing drag with no end, a race with no finish line, a place with no pleasure, filled with corporations that only want your money and filthy streets with homeless people.

,depression,"I don't say this to invalidate the feelings of anyone else, but as a depressed person I feel like an outcast even to those who depressed also. This is because I can't relate to the variety of depression that seems to be the most common. By that I mean the self-loathing, feeling like everyone hates you, feeling like a failure and a loser. Don't get me wrong, I have certainly had plenty of those thoughts and feelings too. But my depression is centred less around my self-esteem and more around a deep existential dread and fear of death. 

It's difficult to see the point in anything when we're all going to die anyway. I worry about wasting my time on working or my creative hobbies, because I should be spending the limited time I have on this earth with the people I love. I have so little time and so much to do but it's such an overwhelming feeling of fear that I end up freezing, paralysed on my bed not doing anything at all. 

Historically I haven't dealt with break-ups well because I can't bear the idea of wasting months of my life grieving and trying to move on. What if I died whilst I was in the midst of severe grief following a break-up or loss? I would've spent my final months and moments absolutely miserable. 

I lived alone for a few years until my current partner moved in with me, and that was hell. If I'd died whilst I was living alone, I might not have spoken to anyone in person for weeks leading up to my death. We waste so much of our finite time just trying to survive. Working towards a better future. But what if we don't have a future? 

I don't want to kill myself. I want to live forever and have the time I need to experience happiness. I don't want my life to have ended in pointless suffering and misery. I don't want to constantly look at my cats and my partner and my sister and think about how one day they'll all be dead. It hurts so fucking badly. Time passes so quickly and so weirdly that it could feel as though I blinked at 27 and opened my eyes at 80 on my deathbed. I cannot fathom the concept of no longer existing. I cannot fathom my loved ones ceasing to exist. But I'm constantly reminded about it by my stupid brain. 

This used to give me crazy panic attacks. I couldn't even read words like ""corpse"" or ""coffin"" without freaking out. Reading Frankenstein for my English class when I was 14 was weeks of recurring torture. The passage about how people become food for worms is burnt into my memory. I used to look at people doing things and having dreams and wonder... why? What's the point? To paraphrase Macbeth, our life is so fragile and brief, like a flickering candle. People have been dying for millions of years. When Shakespeare wrote Macbeth, he was just as alive as we were. And now he hasn't existed for hundreds of years. The same will happen to us, and to everyone born in the thousands of years after us, long after our physical bodies have been completely consumed by the earth.
