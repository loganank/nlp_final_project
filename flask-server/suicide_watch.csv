###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

,SuicideWatch,"I was meeting up with this one girl, we had planned on having sexual interactions. But before we had these sexual interactions we had a discussion about what would happen if by chance she became pregnant (we used a condom). And we both agreed that she’d get an abortion if that were the case. A week or so after the deed, she texts me informing me that she might be pregnant, I was one of the last people to find out because some of my friends we’re actually telling me about it prior to when she told me, but I didn’t believe them because why would she tell others before me? Right? But no she told lots of people. She took 4 tests and the 4th one ended up being positive. Then I talked to her about what was going to happen, offered to help pay for the abortion which we both agreed on and is perfectly legal to do so in this country. But every time I’d try to get an answer out of her, she’d dodge the question. Which is a really bad sign. So now today she went to the doctor to get blood work to confirm if it’s truly a pregnancy or not. She is ruining my life, now that she broke the agreement we had, every time we talk she always get so defensive and blames me for attacking her verbally when I’m just trying to get answers. 
If this does end up being a confirmed pregnancy there’s no way I’m living to see the child, because from what it looks like now she’s crazy and wants to keep it.

&lt;p&gt;The last person on the list is my abusive, domineering dad. I can&amp;#39;t end contact with him yet, but I&amp;#39;ll get there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m done with all of it. Every single one of my choices had helped me breathe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry if you&amp;#39;re going through something similar. This is my story and what helped me see light at the end of a dark tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;

I loved her more than anything, and I ruined the relationship. I'm a broken man. Nobody - certainly not her - is ever going to love me. I can't be fixed. All I wanted was to be loved by a partner. 

I can not function anymore. I've been on medical leave for weeks, and work today is excruciatingly painful and stressful.

On Saturday night, I will kill myself via poison. It's supposed to set me off to sleep and deprive my brain of oxygen. There's little chance of failure.

Why should I care when I don't know if I will unalive myself tomorrow or not, or you know, burn down a few houses of those ai bros and jump onto the fire myself too?

I'm sorry, I would never do that, at least not the latter. I have always loved art as a kid, and I love it even more now as an adult where I have the opportunity to pursue it seriously. But this past year has been so miserable for me, I used to love sitting at the desk, turning on a piece of song I love and just drawing whatever world I image, I used to love browsing through the list of my favorite artists and see the absolute masterpiece they create, and hoping to myself that one day I could just be like them, I used to love gifting an art piece to a friend and see them be so happy receiving it as we jokingly talk about how talented I am and one day I could be a new Leonardo da Vinci even though I drew like dogshit back then.

But now?

I forced myself to go to the gym last night and felt great after, then forced myself to do another Italian lesson, so thankful I did. I am feeling more worthy now.

,SuicideWatch," 

I'm  a college student. I first got diagnosed with depression when I was in  8th grade (14 years old). I've taken Zoloft, recently switched to  Celexa, I've been in and out of therapy, I've exercised, I've journaled,  I've meditated, I've kept schedules, I have friends and a supportive  relationship. I followed the steps I was supposed to follow to get  better. I'm in therapy. I joined a student mental health union. I'm  involved in the community. I feel like I should be content at the very  least.

Although some times have  been better and some times have been worse, it is like I can never fully  be satisfied with my life. It feels like there is something  fundamentally wrong with me preventing me from being fully human. It is  like I have distractions for a while, but I always simply return to the  same thing. The methods therapists tell me to do help some, but never  enough.

I don't know what to do  anymore. My main hope is that things will be better when I graduate  college, but at the same time I don't know how much the way my life is  actually contributes to how I feel, or if how I feel is mainly due to my  inability to cope or handle stressors that most people can.

My  friends don't understand because they've never experienced this, and  when I talk about it being hard to get out of bed and wanting to drop  out of school and go home they don't really take it seriously. My  partner listens to me, but the most they can do is say ""I'm sorry you  feel this way"" or ""that isn't true"" when I talk about how I feel useless  and worthless.

They have always been so supportive of me and even paid for me to study abroad, all expenses covered. All they ask is that I do well. Instead, I have wasted millions of my country&amp;#39;s currency on things I don&amp;#39;t even want, and on top of that I have failed enough classes that I won&amp;#39;t be eligible for the immigration pathway, which was the whole point of my going there. I used to excel and now I am honestly just so lost. I don&amp;#39;t know if I can face my parent&amp;#39;s disappointment and more importantly I don&amp;#39;t think I can keep living with the disappointment I have for myself. I used to dream so big, and so bright when I was younger. I had so many plans for myself, plans I was so excited about but now I think I fucked it up. I am so lonely, I have a great group of online friends but for people in real life, I am lacking. This probably would be the most selfish the I have done or will ever do. I get endless support from my parents and I repay them with killing myself? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My little sister, my sweet little sister, is going to grow up with an older sister. I am gonna leave everyone in my life, everyone who has done me good, I am gonna leave them all fucked. I know the consequences of what I will do, just like all the previous decisions I made, and from the looks of it just like before, I am still going to go through with it.&lt;/p&gt;

Hello,

I enjoy being alone most of the time, I don't like to interact with people at all unless it's necessary, and that's just how it is. I was in the Marines for 4 years, got out honorably last august, family was proud of me and everything, but I think I took the freedom aspect of getting out way too seriously, I didn't get a job, bought an apartment and I'm just living in it, it's been so long since I've gone and done anything social, I've cut all ties with my military friends, but I miss them.. I'm just ashamed that they'll see what I've become: an overweight, depressed loser who's too scared to do anything with his life because he's afraid to walk out the front door.. the complacency has set in and there's really nothing I can do to help it, I'm so ashamed of how others will perceive me that I just don't go out at all, I think it's because after being in here not getting any exercise or daily sunlight has spiraled me into a severe depression/anxiety, (I haven't gone to a psychiatrist or a therapist for the same reasons). I hate what I've become and I'm too fucking scared to do shit about it.. . I have family that I've just flat out told horrible things to so they would stop seeing me, contemplated ending it but I'm also a coward so, there's that. I just want to be myself again..

not looking for pity or sympathy, just wanted to share this.

It’s a really long story but through combinations of bad help by university (and for years, not just once. But rn they have reached a new level), mistakes on my end, me being very empathetic and easy to take advantage of, and a lot more. I’ve gotten myself into a spot where I’ve had such a high work pressure I can’t take it anymore and I feel like I broke.

To give some perspective to the situation last week I had to teach myself a subject that was supposed to be thought over 7 weeks in 2 days for an exam I only knew I had 3 days before. The reason why it’s like that is complicated but largely on the school side.

I’m not sure who to talk to… I’ve been in therapy before and fairly long too. 3 years that time but it wasn’t as effective as I hoped. Especially the last 2 years barely did anything. And the waiting list was unbearable. And otherwise I’m so scared to lose people if I talk to them.

I’m lacking the energy to do anything. Since Saturday I’ve essentially spent all of that time in bed other then 2 times for a few hours for a meeting and a family members birthday. I’ve been severely neglecting personal hygiene as well, I want to fix it but I just lack the energy.

To try and keep up with everything despite the lack of energy I’ve also been abusing some medication. Which is a large part of why I’m scared to lose people. I have an ADD diagnosis and get medication for that. But I get more then I need and don’t use it some days so I can use more on others. I’ve taken upto 120mg in a day which I know is segnificantly more then I should be taking. But some days I feel like I don’t have a choice if I want to get anything done.

I’ve also had a super hard time relaxing and sleeping. Which is the other thing I’m concerned might make me lose people if I talk to them. I by now smoke weed daily in order to sleep and still often end up falling asleep on the couch or chair instead of bed essentially smoking myself to sleep. It’s legal here and I do smoke small doses (about 10-15 grams a month) but it’s not something i like to depend on for sleep and piece of mind.

I’ve had incredible headaches during all of this, not daily but I’d say half the days or so. For those been taking a good bit of paracetamol and ibuprofen too.

Most of them don&amp;#39;t start a conversation with me, I have to start it, most of them exclude me when they organize something. My best friends that I&amp;#39;ve known for all my whole life just don&amp;#39;t care about me, i hate to say it, but he message me back like once a week if I&amp;#39;m lucky, he disappear and don&amp;#39;t send me news for weeks sometimes, a few weekends ago he came to my flat, we drunk a bit (with expansive s alcohol that i bought) and then went to a concert (that I paid for, to be fair I already bought the ticket and I just asked him if he wanted to come, which surprisingly he was fast to reply to me for that), it ended at like 11pm and he refused categorically to go back to my place to drink more not giving me really any excuse, he didn&amp;#39;t really pay for anything, even tho I told him to bring some alcohol. I don&amp;#39;t really have anyone to talk to (and sadly when I am wasted and sad I just send a lot of message to someone that never wanted me, yet I still can&amp;#39;t get over her, she doesn&amp;#39;t reply, and the next day I send a sorry I was drunk, don&amp;#39;t read it, text), I don&amp;#39;t really feel like talking about personal stuff to the person I&amp;#39;m kinda dating, I don&amp;#39;t wanna burden her and it&amp;#39;s still very early, I take a lot of time to open up, and even tho I feel like we have a lot of things in common, I thought on my way back home from our third date, of sending her a text saying &amp;quot;you deserve better than me&amp;quot;, I don&amp;#39;t know if I should be loved, or if I deserve any love. Kinda ironic that I take a lot of time to open up as I am saying that publicly lmfao. It&amp;#39;s a bit of a lot of information lmao.
Recently I did bungee jump, two times, and the first time i did, as i was falling down, my brain thought that I was gonna die, as a basic instinct I guess. And it felt good, like inner peace, and it&amp;#39;s the happiest I&amp;#39;ve ever been in years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m lost I don&amp;#39;t know what to do, I&amp;#39;m thinking of getting hospitalized, maybe, but it kinda makes me wanna die even more being there, so I don&amp;#39;t know. I just want everything to end.&lt;/p&gt;

I had my first suicidal ideation a few weeks ago. It literally came out of nowhere, and I am still questioning if I really want suicide, or if I am just too stressed/ depressed. I am in college, and getting through a class while you're thinking about suicide is so goddamn hard. It's like a fucking tornado that just appear out of nowhere just to tear you apart and you're just trying to hold onto yourself and not fucking cry and embarrass yourself in front of the whole class. 

It happened again today in my math class, and it's been difficult to follow since I couldn't bring myself together to revise after all that happened over the past few weeks. The professor was doing a proof and I am just trying my best to follow, but I've missed so many things in the last couple of weeks it just gets more frustrating the more I try to understand.

Oh, here it comes. A calm sea suddenly rocked by storms and angry waves. Breathe in... hold it in... breathe out... I can hardly see what my professor is writing on the screen now. God damn get a grip you son of a bitch. My heart felt like it was stabbed, and with each stab instead of blood, tears are trying to rush out. 

Usually it subsides with a few more deep breathes, but god damn I don't know when I am actually going to cry in class.  It's not that I really care if I cry in class, but if I do, I think I'll be way down. I still go to the gym regularly and I still eat fine and I have no problems with substances. But damn I feel it all slowly collapsing. I am starting to enjoy drinking (I get drunk easily), and my sleep schedule is turning into a mess. I know some of y'all have it way worse than I do, and I am sorry for all of those who have to go through this, it's terrible. 

And shit I really need them grades to be good... I've already fucked up my last semester.

I don&amp;#39;t know of anything that could make me happy and yes I have tried. It all seems meaningless. Sometimes when the days are not so bad and I feel like I am going to make it and get out of this mental space, next moment a thought strikes in my head that it&amp;#39;s all too much and it&amp;#39;s better to end it all. A thought strikes that till when will I keep running from this inescapable truth that one day really soon I&amp;#39;m gonna kill myself so why not do it now. This makes me afraid and wanna cry and scream and ask someone to help me ..but I am really helpless. I have a family, but they don&amp;#39;t care. I don&amp;#39;t have any friends who could really understand this. Medical options I have given up on. It&amp;#39;s completely lonely here. It feels like nothing in this world can help me and I&amp;#39;m running from the only truth I&amp;#39;ll ever know, that one day soon I&amp;#39;m gonna... 
I don&amp;#39;t wanna die maybe, I want to live but I don&amp;#39;t know if it&amp;#39;s possible at this point or how. Anything I do I&amp;#39;m always surrounded by this thought - that I&amp;#39;m unnecessarily running from my pre decided fate.
I maybe want to live a little longer but I can&amp;#39;t find the help or guidance I need and it would be very disappointing to leave this world with all my unrealised dreams.&lt;/p&gt;

     i’m also extremely socially anxious and awkward and social situations are absolute hell for me. i avoid talking to any customers or coworkers, and if they talk to me i have some preset responses in my brain, and if they go “off script” i start stumbling over my words and the conversation becomes very painful for everyone involved until they leave. if i make a mistake and i get corrected i break down and feel completely useless.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi, everyone. My current situation is absurdly bad and I have no clue what to do.

I’m 17 and I live in a provincial Russian town. Never liked this place, this country and everything around me, but that’s not the most important thing.

In a month I’ll be 18, which means I could get conscripted to the army and I’d probably end up in Ukraine, which not only I believe is plainly wrong and immoral, to me that would also be a death sentence. Knowing all of that, I want to get out of here, but here’s a problem - I don’t have any money and my parents neither.

Luckily, I have Jewish roots, however this also has some issues. 1. The temporary citizenships (Darkons, if I’m not mistaken) are no longer given out at the airports. My only way of getting into Israel is paying for a plane ticket (my parents said they could do that), but then I’d have to live somewhere there before I get the bundle of absorption (if that’s how it’s called). So once again I have to pay for a place to live…

I even called the Jewish Agency. What they said was that I should apply for a program like Sela, so that I can study in Israel, but the problem is these programs only start in autumn, and so I I might not be left out of Russia as I would be “obliged to serve the country” by law.

I feel absolutely terrible. I don’t know what to do. My parents basically told me to fuck off and they want me to leave as soon as possible, because I’m “annoying” and they don’t like me. They are the type of parents who beat their children and think it’s morally right to do so. Living with them is awful. While they stopped beating me as soon as they realised I could now “protect myself” (basically they realised I am physically stronger than them now), they still daily say offensive shit to me for no reason at all.

Lack of support in this tough situation really makes me suicidal. I’ve got nobody nowhere. I am on my own in this very fucked up place.

&lt;p&gt;I even called the Jewish Agency. What they said was that I should apply for a program like Sela, so that I can study in Israel, but the problem is these programs only start in autumn, and so I I might not be left out of Russia as I would be “obliged to serve the country” by law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel absolutely terrible. I don’t know what to do. My parents basically told me to fuck off and they want me to leave as soon as possible, because I’m “annoying” and they don’t like me. They are the type of parents who beat their children and think it’s morally right to do so. Living with them is awful. While they stopped beating me as soon as they realised I could now “protect myself” (basically they realised I am physically stronger than them now), they still daily say offensive shit to me for no reason at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lack of support in this tough situation really makes me suicidal. I’ve got nobody nowhere. I am on my own in this very fucked up place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any help, and even just words would mean the world to me. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

\*Don’t tell me to just move out. I have ten cents to my name. I will become more suicidal if you say that to me.\*

,SuicideWatch," 

I knew i was different... From a young age, I always enjoyed my own company... And highly introverted... During childhood it was the happiest year of my life... To think back then I made more friends when i was a kid than an adult lol ...

Highschool was fucking nightmare at the time i was dealing with addiction, social anxiety and major depressive episodes, everyday life i went to bed with anxious and depressed, i had suicidal thoughts each and everyday..., when i woke up depressed and anxious same cycle for years... I lost most of my friends and i was considered loser, weak, nerd, geek whatever you name it... it turned most of my childhood friends off But no one tried to bully me since i was quiet and serious also all my friends from preschool are popular people and some sort of gangshit, back then we were still in touch... I always avoid making new contacts and prefer close friends... Small circle ofc...

Talking about studying high school I did not do well cause of mental issues... I am lacking focus, i never review or learn anything cause i was in my own head most of the time... I spend time drawing. Lol i still wondered how the fuck i passed all those class when i didn't even learn anything... Weird is i got decent grades lol

From mental issues and insecurities... i was easily hurt and mentally dependent, i cut off most friends from my mental health... I was screaming for help and understanding... I could not afford therapy, so I decided to cure myself... It was 2018 when i decided to cut off my addiction and started to overcome my anxiety processing... It was one hell of a recovery journey without professional help... During withdrawal episodes, it was crippled anxiety and major depressive episodes... Due to the unbalanced brain chemical of dopamine... I fought so hard alone trying to get my life back together... I cut off people who know me, when i was at my lowest point of life... Cause i wasn't myself...

Again another horrific event... after a year of recovered addiction.... I lost myself once again... Cause i was too lonely, i craved people's company, and meanings in life, i saw people on social media having fun posting pictures together and tagging each other was so much fun... I thought having friends would make me happier... It was really painful memories... Even though my anxiety was still killing me but at least, i got socializing... I joined a club full of people, and they had a moto of being nice to each other... I fell into that, cause i was craving happiness... I tried to change my own personality and went against my own nature... Just to be likeable... I shut off my Te entirely and focused more on my Fe... that's how everything went downhill... People view me as a clown and look down on me etc.. i was hurt after being excluded and abandoned maybe cause i was getting too comfortable, i started to tease... Once i use my teasing and sarcastic comments to a specific person that means I like the person... Not romantically just friends... After being so hurts i realized it out... Seeking happiness from others wasn't the right choice... I started going back into my own shell and rethinking life once again..i cut off all the people i knew from the club... Cause they already viewed me as a pathetic loser already... I tried to avoid contact as much as possible... I came to realize I have problem keeping long-term friendship

In 2019... I took a break from people's bullshit and decided to be true to myself ... I finally came to realize all I needed was... Happiness came from within... Everything starts from the inside, i wasn't happy with myself for years how am I expecting other people to make me happy? I realized the main problem to cause this loneliness was me... I stopped blaming life or blame on god punishment... I started self doubt and hatred towards myself even more... I had a strong suicidal thoughts again... To avoid killing myself, i tried self care and building myself... I went looking for a job as a barista cause i love coffee but the job .. i didn't like it, my boss was emotionally manipulated, i was underpaid and overworked... Salary lesser than Uber driver... The only thing I loved about that job was drinking coffee for free lol... What i learned from my old job was understanding that everyone is different, you can't let them adapt to you, base on your own perspective, you must learn to accept other's flaws first... I was still being excluded from the staff's event party etc... Cause being myself is like this lol, everyone surely hates me cause i was really misunderstood...

In 2021 this was the peak of reaching my true self... I finally found the job I wanted... As a video editor, i was so good at it, that my boss was impressed... The first time of my life that i felt like I was doing something right... But i still hate my other boss, he is a narcissist and controlling... My anxiety relapsed cause of him... The first time I went to a therapist and was diagnosed with GAD (general anxiety disorder)... It is a hell of a living once again but at least this time I am able to control and maintain my anxiety well... I still can socialize and go to places... I was still alone anyways but i just got used to being leftout, that my emotional is numb...

2023... Ioneliness is killing me inside... I became my own worst enemy than previous years... Everyone had friends eating lunch together at work, i was still a loner, in case of dealing with lack of trust from others and afraid of being excluded and abandoned...even though i worked there for almost 2 years now all my colleagues hate me... They are all talking fun and laughing, I'm serious alone and doing my own thing... I knew it was a punishment from god... I was doomed with loneliness and finally all the bad things happened to me... I accepted my own fate... i could not change it... Currently 22s almost end my college years while doing part time jobs at the same Time... Zero friends, life full of sadness and loneliness... My whole family also doesn't understand me and they hate me as well... My mom hopes she didn't give birth to me... My big brother is the opposite of me, he's extroverted and has a life of parties... And he looked down on me...

I could not find happiness as I was supposed to... I still need people who are willing to accept me as friends... I'm insecurity about dating if the girl finds out I'm a loner, she is going to think I'm pathetically weak and loser that no one wants to be friends with... My social media has zero messages... Life is nothing to me but loneliness and emotional numbness... I do not know how to make friends anymore in this state... I'm about to give up on everything... Since like i find no peace within myself and even an impact on other people's life... My presence causes bad vibes, people wish i wasn't there... My life circle is to get up, go to work, go to school, go home, play online games alone... I hate my own existence... Everything is fucking boring and pathetic... What a fucking loser

,SuicideWatch,"Last night I had my ""first"" conscious attempt, it was partial suspension. 
I almost did it, but survival instinct hit hard and I had to stop- so close yet so far.

It has been the worst night of my life. Before attempting I had bawled for 2~ hours nonstop, I was totally hammered.

Today I am alive. And I really thought life would show me something beautiful the day after.
I know I'm not entitled to anything, but still I assumed life would treat me a little more kindly.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi, everyone. I've been dealing with depression and suicide thoughts (and attempts..) since I was 13. Sometimes these thought and/or attempts come and stay for a while, sometimes the stay dormant for quite a while, even for years. My first 11 times (yes, I counted them) were with a belt, I was trying to choke myself, but none of them succeeded. 

Today I'm 29 years old, I've been dating my girlfriend for almost 4 years. She has a daughter of 5, which I love from the bottom of my heart, and I want to be part of her life as her father. 

Since I started dating her, I started to fall in debt, some of that because sometimes she doesn't like the cheap things. My first loan was for helping her pay college, she dropped from there. We had our fights, and really bad ones indeed. Some of those times, these suicidal thought come back, and stronger. I tried to jump through my 2 floor window several times, and even I hit myself hard, one of those with a bleeding wound. 

My ""friends"" (who she stated in a drunken manor that she hates them) live in another city. I don't have anyone to talk or to make friends. Over 90% of the things I want to say I don't because of fear that she will get pissed or mad, and when she gets mad, she tries to breakup. This normally happens at least once a week. And sometimes she indirectly pressures me to get maried bye a specific date, because she doesn't want more children after certain age, sometimes she even tells me she doesn't want another one, other times she does. 

I once made a mistake by introducing as my best friend to her a girl that we used to be fuck buddies (I know, big mistake, I don't relate or talk to that person anymore). Even after years of that, sometimes when she gets mad of ANOTHER reason, she brings that, and other thing that don't relate. I think she will never let pass or forgive entirely those thing. Sometimes when she gets mad (and some times by another person's fault) she says to our daughter that I'm not her father, and that forbidden her to tell me dad. I always feel broken everything that happens. 

I'm sick and tired of talking to myself only. I sometimes don't feel happy with her, but I always tell her that it's OK and I'm fighting for us and our family. I've heard many times form her that she is not happy anymore, no matter how much I try. 

The thing is, if this ends, I'll loose my daughter. Forever. To the point that she will never let me speak with her again due to the breakup. And now these suicidal thoughts are back, and strong.

What can you tell me that is going to make me feel better? You don't know my situation and even I were to describe the choices i've made up until now, its not like you could possibly understand the intestacies. I could never explain well enough. Hell, I can't even understand well enough. At the end of the day, like any normal person you want to see me live regardless of what's going on. You will say anything to ""get me off the ledge"".

It's not something I can think about out loud.

It's hard to think. I feel tired in so many ways. I've made to make mistakes too quickly and I have too much to do for what may mean nothing anyways. How can I think about my choice if i have no one to talk to properly other than myself. It will be soon. Probably. Or never. I don't know. I can't even tell if its still up in the air. Can you make a decision like this spontaneously? I know that method has a lot to do with second thoughts and whatnot, but with the method I've chosen, there is basically no chance to dip. It will be for all intents and purposes done in seconds. Painless, quick, and with little to no mess. How long do people normally take to make decisions like these?

Everyone is so nice. Everyone wants the best for me. My friends and family would do anything to see me happy. No one wants nothing for me. There exists no neutral party to consult. It's either you gotta live or you gotta die. No in between. This is so stupid. This whole post. I'm so tired. Thinking about so much so fast is hard. I've always has the though at the back of my head, but not it's completely at the front. It has been for weeks. Is is because I'm stressed or have I reached a conclusion?

My life feels pointless, I feel like a failure, tbh.. I don’t think many people would be bothered if I did actually follow up with suicide. I don’t want to die, I have dreams and goals I want to achieve but I don’t see a way out of this.., all of it has been affecting my college and work life too , worsening things..&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"5 months ago I cheated on my boyfriend for 8 years by sexting w some stranger. I broke up 5 days later. It's the worst thing I've ever done and hopefully will ever do to someone. I never strayed in any way before. I still can't comprehend what I did. Although it was a relationship with jealousy and control, there were so much of that which we'd overcome and evolved from. So many beautiful memories. My heart still physically hurts and so it should. I  did the unforgivable.

I love him more than anoyone, but what does love even mean to a person like myself who's able to completely destroy and betray someone they supposedly love?

I deserve everything I get.

I'm constantly nauseous. I tremble and feel dizzy. Too much shit has happened in these last 5 months, I've become physically ill, there's a high rate of infection in my blood but the doctors can't tell from what.

The depression in me has been ongoing since I was 12, I feel like there is something way worse in me than has yet been diagnosed.

Bottom line is that I've been defeated, or more so I've defeated myself and everyone around me. I have broken myself down. I've made concrete plans. It's so hard to collect my thoughts, even here. I wish I could scream, I wish there was someone to cry to, even though I don't even deserve a shoulder to cry on. I hope the pain lessens and I hope I'll never return.

,SuicideWatch,"Long story short, my BF (M28) broke up with me (M29) and imposed a no-contact rule, for good half a year now, and these 6 months have been nothing but a downward spiral of surviving in a foreign country. 

I tried freezing to death, hanging myself, locking myself in a garage with a hose pipe attached and engine running, and he didn't care one bit.
Never contacted, only accused me of being a cheater, liar and a manipulator, further enforcing the thoughts that no one on the planet cares.
Last night police knocked down my doors, leaving the house completely smashed in, just to find me in the loft crying my eyes out, drinking and swallowing Nitol.

,SuicideWatch,"I’ve read that when someone you care about is thinking of killing themselves that you’re supposed to not offer solutions or advice but just listen to them and be their friend. I’ve also read that when you’re in love with someone romantically and they and they don’t feel the same way that supposed to do the opposite but I can’t do that in this situation. I know that I can’t make him feel the same about me that I do about him and I can accept that but I can’t abandon him in this situation. 

For a long time I’ve had romantic feelings for someone who only considers me a friend but it’s only within the past couple of days that I’ve been about recognised what I’ve been feeling. A couple of weeks ago this friend of mine posted in our friend groups messager chat about how he felt closer to giving up with every passing day. I asked him him why and he gave a bunch of reasons some of which were about his own personal experience (He’s transgender and he’s family isn’t supportive, he hates his job, no money, etc). He also expresses some pessimistic political opinions which I disagreed with. After he posted this I talked to him in a private message in an attempt to convince him he was wrong. (I know now this was the wrong thing to do so you don’t need to tell me) he tells me he has a responsibility of care to his dog so he would stick around as long as the dog was around. I asked him to promise me he wouldn’t do anything drastic even after that and he said he couldn’t promise that. I was in shocked when he said that I asked if he was serious and then he said “you don’t have the right to live my life for me” after I was so emotional that I wasn’t able to type anything back. After calmed down I asked if he had considered calling a helpline and he told me that they didn’t have a right to tell him what to do with his life either. I offered to help by giving him money and I think he told me that I couldn’t help him because I didn’t have enough to help. which wasn’t true but he didn’t know that. I disclosed information about what I had and he asked “do you really want to help me?” I said “absolutely” then he said he was going for a drive and not to worry if he didn’t get back to me immediately. 

So the next day he gets back to me. He tries to console me by telling me to think of it as an end to his suffering rather than as something to be sad about. I reacted badly to this. I went into a panic and started begging him not to do it I don’t remember how he responded. 

For the next 2 days we made small talk though messager. This made me feel better. I think it was after the second day of making small talk he asked if I remembered the part of the conversation where I offered to help I said I did and he allowed me to loan him money. He knew that I was will to gift him the money but he made it clear that he would not accept a cent if I did not allow him to pay it back and I wasn’t about to argue. 

I did not confess my feelings for 2 reasons the first is that I still somehow didn’t recognise that what I was feeling more the platonic love one has for a friend and second I didn’t want to make it about me but I also didn’t want to give the impression that I wasn’t feeling anything a all. So the day after I gave him the money I told him how much his friendship meant to me. I put this in a purely platonic way. He responded with a very long and very honest account of how he saw it. Basically he sees 2 different ways his life could play out in the near future. One where he moves out and gets a dog and one where he doesn’t. To him it seemed perfectly logical that in the second scenario he’d probably chose to end it. But he said if all goes well that shouldn’t happen. I told him I understood and asked if he would allow me to help him achieve this goal and he said he would only if I allowed him to pay me back and I said okay. 

A week after all this started we meet in person. I was very relieved to see him and he seemed to be in a good mood. During this time we talked about a lot of stuff. I know your not supposed to do this but while we were together I became emotional. He saw me cry a couple times when talking about this. I tried to talk to him about it and it didn’t seem to bother him he didn’t change his mind. I apologised to him for bringing up the topic because I thought I had made the situation worse. He told that his opinion on the matter hadn’t changed. We made small talk for a bit. When it came time for him to leave we hugged and he assured that he would warn me before he did anything but but the way he said it it sounded to me at the time like he like would tell me when he did it and not if he did. This caused me to become emotional but before I could say anything he clarified what he meant while I was emotional told him I felt like I had made things worse but he assured me I didn’t make things worse and that I had helped him (presumably referring to the loan and not our conversation)

A couple days go by and he mentions in the group chat that he’s asexual and aromatic which as I understand basically means he isn’t sexually attracted to anyone weather they’re male or female and he has no romantic interest in anyone. He said this as if everyone in the group already knew but I didn’t remember (I had memory issues for reasons that I won’t go into here but it’s fine now) hearing him say this was by no means the most painful part of all this but my reaction to it helped understand why I reacted as strongly as I did.

,SuicideWatch,"It’s been a long, arduous road and after fighting for 16 long years I just don’t think I have it in me anymore. My childhood was wasted being bullied, dropping out of school and being isolated and friendless since I was a skinny scrawny kid. This led to a myriad of psychosomatic health issues and just more misery. 

At 21, realising I was running out of time and doing nothing with my life I decided to get back into education and began going to the gym. Graduated with top grades at 26 and became muscular and a lot more confident. However the effects of childhood abuse and isolation were as prevalent as ever. I still felt empty, ugly and depressed and behind in life. 

Being 26 now I just feel lost, damaged and behind in life. I am watching people my age and my bullies getting married, having their own places and being fulfilled. Here I am unsure of what career I even want, can’t drive, live with my parents and am struggling financially. 

My two passions are becoming a mixed martial arts fighter or a psychologist. However it’s probably too late for both. Becoming a psychologist entails years of studying so I’d basically be broke till I’m qualified in my 30’s, and becoming a fighter is very precarious - let alone when you start in your 20’s (currently injured and can’t train). 

I’m just tired. I don’t enjoy anything and feel a painful empty gaping hole in my heart. It’s been this way since I was 10. Plus from being bullied I’m pessimistic and resent people. I’ve been a skinny guy, and I’ve been muscular and it’s crazy how differently I was treated.

,SuicideWatch,"I don't want to die when I'm old and alone. I want to die when I'm young and alone.

Incidentally, I'm actually about to run out of space on my phone and in the free cloud. So this works out pretty well, saves some money. Life hack.

Every list is a bucket list after you've decided to die.

I was wondering about if a suicide note can double as a will. Turns out it can! But then I was thinking about what I would leave who... um, I *will* have nothing. 🤣 A few instruments, little toys and knickknacks, and my rubiks cube. So, no need to worry about the will, probably.

I'm not sure I belong here, but I def do belong dead, cuz that's where we're all going. Everybody's doing it! If your friend jumped off a cliff would you do it too? In this case yes.

I do feel like I have a clear purpose in life again. I'm going to die soon. And things will stop being so temporary.

Don't think of it as an end! Just think of this as sort of like a bad new beginning.

I work for a funeral service that had the contract for the medical examiner so I pick up dead bodies from hospitals crime scenes etc. and today I picked up a suicide. And I saw an exit bag. And I had notes. It was a pretty surreal experience. First off. Kinda sucks that the bag stays on. Idk what I was expecting, but looks less peaceful. I know they'll take it off eventually. The bag itself was a white trash bag, and I prefer my clear design. There was a zip tie instead of elastic too. But it's good to know I can throw one together in a pinch if I have to. He was much older. He had kids. I feel proud for knowing when to stop.

The secret wasn't LOVE. It turns out the real secret was DYING. Nobody could tell us because they're all dead... But it wasn't love. Turns out it was DYING all along.

1. Shower
2. Eat breakfast
3. Push ups
4. Try to eat breakfast again
5. Watch the last episode of Friends
6. Kill self
7. Eggs

It's like Pokémon. Argon, I choose you!

It ends ;)

It's so good that it just ends after.

This is all very embarrassing. And dramatic. I know that I guess. Idk why I'm doing this. Acting this way. I regret it. I guess. But whatever. See above.

The song suicide is painless, the theme for mash, was written by a 15 year old. They wanted the lyrics to be stupid. But I kind of like them. I like watch it grin. Anyway, this is more of just a pop culture fact.

I'm thinking of turning this space into just somewhere I post pop culture facts to, for the rest of my life, as long as I can, until I can't anymore. Would you like that? Let me know in the comments!

Movies and TV. All the characters, I feel like they all want to live. Deep down. I feel like they have something to for. Now I feel like that's unrealistic. Like. Not everybody. COMEON, THE BEAR!!! (said in a Chicago accent)

Life is fucking weird. Listen: it is weird that *anything is manufactured.

No matter how crazy you feel or how removed from reality you are or depressed, there is always, always the immutable fact of death. No matter where your mind is

I want to be the world's leading expert on something. Maybe something to do with math or computers. But I see a tree up ahead and it occurs to me that I could cut to the chase and become the leading expert on death. I will become the most recent person to know more about the subject than any living person.

Um I don't know why I'm making this post, I think it's just a vent. 

What really sucks, is wanting to give up and end everything, but not being able to kill myself. I don't think I'm afraid of death, but I feel like I'll do it impulsively rather then have an end date. 

Life has worn me down. I've been on and am on endless waiting lists of mental health services. I've been through various talking therapies and no matter what happens. I always end up back at the point I'm at now. 

I'm alone, I have no real life connections. I work from home and going into the office has no one I know around. 

I'm extremely happy when a relationship is on the table, but they are found through things like tinder and let's be honest, it's not really a place to find a genuine connection 😅. 

I've already given up, I'm going through life because I have to and because I haven't plucked up the courage to kill myself yet. 

I haven't self harmed in a month or so which is good, but I feel like I'm doing that because it's not socially acceptable not because i want to. If I had it my way I'd be self harming to cope so much more often. 

My sleep isn't great, I use weed as a sleep aid. Getting to sleep has never been easy. I need constant stimulation, whether it's listening to music or listening to videos. If I've not got something to stimulate me the dark thoughts come very quickly :). It's been like this since I was 15, it's a habit I can't shake and don't have the emotional capability to overcome. The weed helped, however I'm now in a cycle of falling asleep high and have shit qaulity sleep. Or trying to sleep sober and wanting to die. 

I'm really at the end of the line. 

I'm on a waiting list for an ASD assessment which is great, but even if I get a diagnosis, that changes nothing. 

I have absolutely no one, no connections, no friends in real life and genuinely nothing to live for. No matter what happens, even if things seem like they are getting better, give it a few months, maybe more, I'm back at sqaure one, just worse. This cycle has broken me.

,SuicideWatch,"I used to be considered a very bright kid, albeit a kid with issues. I was in the gifted program, was beginning to teach myself to program unprompted by the end of middle school, and had interests that were precocious. I remember being told by a teacher in senior year that I was ""obviously intelligent"" but didn't try and that it would be a waste if I chose not to go to college.

After a couple years of working random labor jobs, I seem to have lost all of my intelligence to the point where people literally think I'm mentally handicapped. For all I know they're right. I have zero ability to hold a conversation. I can't retain any information, though I'm not sure if this is from a lack of interest or a lack of cognitive ability. I've had jobs where I've been bullied constantly by everyone on the team because they thought I was retarded and a hazard around the lift equipment. I'm 23 and I work as a produce clerk, stocking shelves. Every day I hear some parent telling their kid that I'm retarded, and that's why I work there. It's become pretty much omnipresent in my life. People see a retarded person trying to act normal and it sticks out like a sore thumb, and they just have to comment on it. I'm not kidding. I hear these comments constantly, every day. And I'm sure it's not just me hearing things. All the fucking time.

I recently had to drop a chemistry class because the labs were too difficult for me. Again, I wasn't really trying at all so I'm not sure if it's because I've somehow become retarded or if it's due to schizophrenia or something, or the effects of the Benadryl I was abusing for a couple years.

My therapist tells me I'm not retarded, but nearly everyone else except for my parents seems to realize immediately that I'm retarded right after meeting me and seeing the look on my face. But nobody will be straight with me.

How am I going to survive? Am I just going to be one of those developmentally disabled people working at the grocery store while living with their parents? Is that all I am? Do I have the intellectual capacity to work a job that I can support myself on?

&lt;p&gt;My therapist tells me I&amp;#39;m not retarded, but nearly everyone else except for my parents seems to realize immediately that I&amp;#39;m retarded right after meeting me and seeing the look on my face. But nobody will be straight with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How am I going to survive? Am I just going to be one of those developmentally disabled people working at the grocery store while living with their parents? Is that all I am? Do I have the intellectual capacity to work a job that I can support myself on?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking of trying suicide by slitting my wrists and neck. I don&amp;#39;t want to live like this. &lt;/p&gt;

I plan on asking after my birthday. (Which is in two days) I’ll be turning 17. They should be finding out tomorrow that I cut myself. Whether it be from me or my therapist. I’m struggling. I don’t think I can live in society the way I am now. There’s so much to explain. My profile is full of details so just stalk there if you’re curious. 

Therapy has never been much help to me. Medication is okay but no one listens to me and everyone wants to take me off of it. I’ve been in therapy for 6 years and have gotten incredibly worse. 

I can’t get a job, I can’t go to the store, I can’t even be alone with myself or there will be intrusive thoughts. Even my dreams have been compromised. Full of death and abuse. 

I forgot how to feel. How to retain memories. How to focus. How to think for myself. I feel so trapped and so empty. My body is covered in cuts right now. But god it will never be enough. I can’t show how much pain I am from the outside. It’s not enough proof. It’s so much worse in my head than my measly scars. 

I’m not scared of myself. Maybe that’s part of the problem. I can do things without emotion. Sure, the pain is horrid but for some reason it doesn’t matter to me. I used to be scared of myself before my emotions started to go away. I used to be scared of what I’d do if I didn’t get help but now I stopped caring. I want to be able to care again. About myself and others.

the dose was 300mg, my usual dose is 50mg, i wanna do it again but twice as much 600mg, 12 times my regular dose

i feel a little bit shitty but honesty the symptoms of 300mg werent too bad. like i had insomnia and couldnt sleep all tonight (i also really didnt try very hard though) and also yesterday my heartbeat was a little weird, like it wasnt exactly racing but it felt kind of heavy and/or prominent, but that could have also just been me focusing too much on it. my stomach doesnt even hurt or anything it's just feels a little sore but that also could be because i havent eaten anything haha

i dont plan to die, nor do i want to, i dont see the 300mg thing as an attempt or anything. i was trying to OD i guess, but not to any lethal or actually dangerous amount? i know trying to completely lethally OD on prozac is 1) a terrible idea because it takes a LOT to do and 2) i would feel so fucking awful and probably end up dying in the hospital or something getting charcoal shoved down my throat.

I think 600mg is enough to where i wouldnt have to go to the hospital or anything but its also a larger amount than 300mg and does make me a little nervous ig? like im nervous but i still really want to do it. i wouldnt go to the hospital if i did, i didnt with 300mg, and also i dont want my family or friends to hear about this

im in college though, i live on the other side of the state from  my parents so i guess i could go to the hospital? since im over 18 and like, living independantly and dont have any records in any hospitals near my college could i just like. not tell them? id still have to pay hospital fees though and also would probably get stuck in a 72 hr stay, and my roomates would obviously find out since i would like. not come home for a bit haha

why take the 300mg in the first place? i guess i just wanted to do something dangerous and risky. even if the risk is like, very little. 300 seems like such a small amount to me now, despite it being 6 times my regular dose. maybe its because i dont really feel like i ODed on the 300mg? 

i dont drink or anything so at least i have a ton of healthy liver to destroy lmaoo

this is kind of like a vent, i guess. i just needed somewhere to say this, its been burning at the back of my throat and i obviously cant tell anyone i know about this haha, even my therapist. if you made it this far, thank you for listening to what i had to say, despite the subject matter. i know youre just a random ass person on the internet but knowing that  at least one person in the world knows that these feelings exist in me means a lot.

I work every day of the week and my partner works 5. We both work 40+ hours. Maybe we can manage to pay for it but after that we will owe yet another month of rent. We’ve already gotten government assistance and can’t get it again.

and you know what she told me my dad said to her?

""i can't fucking believe you're falling for her tricks. you know she just wants attention and the ability to slack off in her room all day, right??""

he's also borderline physically abusive to me and borderline sexually abusive to my mom. i don't like being close to him in arguments and tense situations. if we've had a fight recently, i don't even want him hugging me. 

he knows i don't like this, so he does it more. he puts his hand on my knee, and when i tell him to stop?

""you're my kid, i can touch you however the fuck i want!!""

he then pretends to laugh and pretends he didn't mean it sexually. he probably means it in that way as well.

my entire life, he's touched my mom inappropriately right in front of me. she's always told him she doesn't like being touched, as she was sexually harassed like crazy as a kid.

""i'm your man, though! i should be able to touch you in that way!""

and then when i try to interfere, he tells me to mind my own business.

for one, that's my fucking mom. and she's a thousand times better of a parent than you.

for two, i'm a major empath and i feel how she's feeling. i really love her, and every time it happens, i want to punt him off a cliff.

i've attempted suicide thres times within the past 2 or so months. im 14. i wish god would just give me mercy. i keep begging Him, but He doesn't ever answer. i often question His existance. but, why would it matter? i'm probably worthless to Him anyways.

sorry for this giant stupid vent. feel free to yell at me in the comments. i've also found my belt recently, which i'm not supposed to have because i nearly hung myself with it. my parents left it on the dryer, and i took it. next time i'm home alone, i'm going to hang myself in the bathroom and go through with it rather than weasling my head out or letting my feet touch the ground. i've done the research. about 74% mortality rate, 4 minutes to kill. so, if i actually do it right this time, i'll most likely die. if the attempt fails and i survive, i'll just take my lunchbox handle and try it again. i should be dead within 1-3 attempts, or about 4-12 minutes total. so, if i can even just do it all at once, i'll finally be free of this worthless suffering.",t2_vmzace9t,False,,0,False,"i keep screaming, but god doesn't hear me.",[],r/SuicideWatch,False,,,0,,False,t3_12pshei,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},2a7b5518-8e45-11e5-a506-0ed10b342609,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,False,,False,modmsg,[],{},,True,,1681757285.0,text,,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;i just fucking wish either me or my dad would die. it&amp;#39;s his fault i have depression and anxiety in the first place, as well as possible ptsd. his dad was physically abusive, so he makes me worship him because he&amp;#39;s only mentally, emotionally, and verbally abusive to me and my mom. in september 2022 when i went for a mental health appointment scheduled by my mom(i subtly cried out for help to her, she noticed)&lt;/p&gt;

Hello, everyone. I'm tearing up as I write this, but I'll try to keep a leveled head when I write this.

But I see no more value in my life. I lost all my friends, I lost my girlfriend I was together with for 4 years, I ended up on drugs and then heroin(which I got fully addicted to 5 years ago, still addicted to this day), etc.

Combined with an **extremely unstable mental health**, a lot of depression, anxiety, etc... And having been gone through lots of traumas, one example being the time I was raped by a guy(and I'm a guy, not even gay), I've also lost everyone. The people who used to be my friends? Doesn't want to even talk to me anymore, not even once in over 5 years. My family? Doesn't want anything to do with me either. My girlfriend? She's an ex now, as she broke up.

Why do they not want anything to do with me? I don't know. I treat them as good as I can, I've done so much for them and try to be as good of a person as I can. But they still hate me, seemingly for no reason. (Except my drug addiction, which doesn't even affect them directly as I get the money for drugs on my own, and even though I some of them know, a lot of them doesn't even know about it).

My life has nothing of value anymore. I'm 24 tomorrow, and things look awfully dark. I could write a billion more sentences on why my life sucks, but I see that as unnecessary, as it won't help anyways, by writing it down. All I know is that I'm done with this awful life and world.

So, yeah. Wish me a happy birthday tomorrow, guys. By this point, all I wish for is to leave this godforsaken world. I haven't told anyone about my intentions, as I don't want anyone to try ""stopping me"". Let's pray I succeed.",t2_qmyg39ra,False,,0,False,There is nothing more of value in my life.

Always felt like I’ve never fit in anywhere. Was raped as a young teen, but it was by a woman, so who was really going to take me seriously? No one did. Started using any and everything I could find shortly after, and that was almost half my life ago. 

Alcohol really came into play about 5 years ago and brought me to my knees like no other drug ever has. Lost all friends, family feel like strangers to me, can’t hold down a job, in debt up to my knees. No way I could manage a SO, even if I could I wouldn’t put someone through that with the mess I’m in right now. What’s the point?

Ended up slitting my wrist last Sunday and some how/some way a rehab friend came to check on me, called 911, got stitched up and 5150’d. Even failed at that. They say they love me, but I just don’t believe it at all. It’s not hate I feel for the world, just an indifference and hopelessness.

&lt;p&gt;Always felt like I’ve never fit in anywhere. Was raped as a young teen, but it was by a woman, so who was really going to take me seriously? No one did. Started using any and everything I could find shortly after, and that was almost half my life ago. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alcohol really came into play about 5 years ago and brought me to my knees like no other drug ever has. Lost all friends, family feel like strangers to me, can’t hold down a job, in debt up to my knees. No way I could manage a SO, even if I could I wouldn’t put someone through that with the mess I’m in right now. What’s the point?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ended up slitting my wrist last Sunday and some how/some way a rehab friend came to check on me, called 911, got stitched up and 5150’d. Even failed at that. They say they love me, but I just don’t believe it at all. It’s not hate I feel for the world, just an indifference and hopelessness.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi, I'm sorry to take your time. I just wanted to talk about it, so I made a throwaway account and went to make this post.

I won't bore you with my entire life but long story short I was very unhappy during my childhood, mostly, we believe, because of bullying. It drove my self-esteem into the ground and I thought multiple times (Sometimes tried to act on it too, thought admitedly not efficiently) of suicide.

A few years down the line and my life got back on track. I found amazing friends that also went through bullying but never quite made it to self-hatred. They picked me up, and despite at first being extremely shy and still a thinking about the easy way out a bit, they sorta ""fixed"" me. I got my life back together and for the past few years, things have been incredibly good for me.  
I got into a relationship with the girl I liked from that exact same group, a relationship that has now lasted for about 3 years or so despite eventually becoming a remote one.

Nowadays, I'm 19 years old, soon to be 20. We all finished high-school and very much keep in contact, sometimes seeing the others during week-ends, and we went our seperate ways in terms of studies. I consider the end of high-school to be the peak of my life as of yet.

Since I didn't know what else to do, and I seemed to have quite a talent and interest for computer-science, I went to study that, in the hopes of going into game-dev eventually.

This is where it goes downhill. It's been... fine, but this last month has been especially bad for me to the point I can't actually wake up feeling like things will change or amount to something. To sum it all up:  
\-During my first year studying in CS I discovered a huge interest in criminology and police work. I want to study these things, I want to learn more about them, but not only will I have wasted 2 years of my life but also thousands for my parents in fees for my current school.  
\-My girlfriend is still as nice as ever, and I do want to spend my life with her, but I don't feel like I deserve her at all. No matter how many times she tells me she loves me, I can't help but think it's out of pity and she'd be better off without me.  
\-I see my friends less and less, which I guess is normal, but we still regularly talk and see each other. But they're the only friends I can manage to have. I just don't get along people at my school and feel extremely lonely for pretty much 90% of my months. Not to mention, again, my girlfriend is about 3 regions away and I can very rarely see her.  
\-I have good grades in my school - best of my class, in fact - but I've been procrastinating on the yearly project so much, for the selfish reason that it does NOT interest me at all (Having to build some sort of team-building organisation web and android app pretty much), that it's now caught up to me. My teacher is threatening to kick me out of the project which would mean doing my second year AGAIN, not mentionning we finally get to specialize into game-dev only during the third year. On top of that I have 2 other major projects to manage, one of which is due next week but nothing has been done because I've been focusing on making up for how late we are in the yearly project so much that I can't find time to work on it for the life of me, and I still don't have a group since the dude that I usually work with - closest thing I have to a friend over there - went to another group because of my fuck up during AGAIN the yearly project.

Now, I don't want to wake up each morning. I feel like I'm losing everything again. all these years of building my life back up feel like they could just go away in instants because I couldn't bring myself to work on one project, which I only have myself to blame for.  
I did my best for a week but apparently not enough for my teacher who once again reminded me of what's at stake. I didn't want to live that evening, let alone going home.  
This week-end I've been trying to work but... I can't bring myself to do it. I don't see the point. I'm going to fail anyway, why even try?  
And once I fail I'll lose everything. My friends, my girlfriend, any respect I've manage to build up for myself, and I'm going to have to announce my parents that they paid the fees for my second year for nothing in the end.  
I don't see the point. I don't want to see myself be miserable again. I want to end it all before that happens.

On top of that I have 2 other major projects to manage, one of which is due next week but nothing has been done because I&amp;#39;ve been focusing on making up for how late we are in the yearly project so much that I can&amp;#39;t find time to work on it for the life of me, and I still don&amp;#39;t have a group since the dude that I usually work with - closest thing I have to a friend over there - went to another group because of my fuck up during AGAIN the yearly project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I don&amp;#39;t want to wake up each morning. I feel like I&amp;#39;m losing everything again. all these years of building my life back up feel like they could just go away in instants because I couldn&amp;#39;t bring myself to work on one project, which I only have myself to blame for.&lt;br/&gt;
I did my best for a week but apparently not enough for my teacher who once again reminded me of what&amp;#39;s at stake. I didn&amp;#39;t want to live that evening, let alone going home.&lt;br/&gt;
This week-end I&amp;#39;ve been trying to work but... I can&amp;#39;t bring myself to do it. I don&amp;#39;t see the point. I&amp;#39;m going to fail anyway, why even try?&lt;br/&gt;
And once I fail I&amp;#39;ll lose everything. My friends, my girlfriend, any respect I&amp;#39;ve manage to build up for myself, and I&amp;#39;m going to have to announce my parents that they paid the fees for my second year for nothing in the end.&lt;br/&gt;
I don&amp;#39;t see the point. I don&amp;#39;t want to see myself be miserable again. I want to end it all before that happens. Even today I can&amp;#39;t work on the project again because I just lifelessly stare at my screen thinking it&amp;#39;s useless.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"this shit is so fucking long if you read this literal clusterfuck, i commend you. it's basically 18 years of suffering, with no sign of getting any better. maybe a shit ton more because even those troubles have centuries-long roots of issues. i don't fucking know at this point. i'm so mad to the point that i became physically incapable of shutting the fuck up when i should've shut up 10 minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years ago.

i have done as much as i could to tell people it's a waste of time to even waste their breath on me... i pushed everyone away, i've started lashing out at people in 2021 and i was sent to the mental hospital not much longer after i wrote the first post on this account. i keep trying to convince everyone im an asshole and that any sliver close to success is because someone else did all the talking and made me into someone im not. im a horrible person, and my whole family knows it.

i yell at friends like someone whos drunken out of their mind. i act all moody with them to get them as emotionally detached from me as possible, even using flailing arms of rage. i lost all my friends because of that. i've started becoming a dick to people i don't even know too well around the same time too and became the person i swore to destroy two years ago. if this is how i treat people, and i hate myself even more, what reason do i have to continue??? i tried therapy, and couldn't continue it anymore because i couldn't tell them everything, and it was too expensive to continue. untold incidences of being a total asshole includes me being a total asshole to anyone i originally thought i cared about. i keep being passive aggressive, and i can't stop it. it's not like i didn't have a choice either, because yeah while that was one of the only things i knew how to be with the shitty people i grew up with, when one of them died, i had the choice to start changing because that was the one who taught me to be a dick. but i didn't stop then like i could have.

i started getting episodes of legitimate anger bursts that people outside of those i pushed away months prior, including strangers and family. one time, i was so tired that i zoned out and stopped in the middle of the road and got the horn honked on me and i wanted them to run me over so bad when i realized what was happening. my relatives in seattle saw my neuroticass behaviour too. those sadomasochistic fucks. they want me to come back. are they insane? do they know just what kind of emotional baggage they have to deal with if my bitchiness goes from wherever i live to seattle? i just wish they would wisen up and ban me the fuck out of that chance because this is all just karma for me being a total asshole. now that my shitty relative (who taught me to be the passive aggressive asshole i am today) died, i come to realize my father is the worst with being so fucking tonedeaf with my health. he pretends he cares for me then constantly blasts borderline misinformation about how people work, how society works, and i always get into arguments with him because of how much i hate his ideals and views on the world. our relationship is strained because i realized that he has been exploiting me for clout for years. for stupid instagram posts where i have to risk breaking my jaw for shit i have to force myself to exaggerate. he does it in public where people can see me, and it makes my situation go from bad to worse because it puts unwanted attention as well as possibly attracts creeps. he's friends with people who genuinely make me feel sick even remembering and he's happy that i can even remember them even if i associate them with something horrible. worst part about it is that i had been under said spotlight for several years and ANY fucking attempt of objection gets vetoed and i have to hold back the urge to jump out of the car and run away, never to be seen again, to hope his car won't catch up with me, but to instead catch onto my shoelace and squash me the same way those stupid fucking posts he makes of me crushed my sanity like a hydraulic press. it's not the only thing i realized he exploited me for. he made me do unpaid labor for about a month when i was in intermediate school over summer, shitty oppressive conditions at a hotel i cannot say for... reasons. i was a cleaner for the rooms and i had to work in shitty muggy conditions all the time without a chance of an AC and the reason it even came about was because he was super understaffed. insult to injury is that i didn't even have a warning about it, one day, he just took me to the area, and i was super confused, and then i ended up in a warehouse full of rags, going back and forth between the hotel rooms. to this day, i get shivers down my spine whenever i even hear the hotel name mentioned, letalone read it anywhere. and worst of all, he always downplays my debilitating mental health issue. he keeps acting like the mildest thing, my lifelong social anxiety is a part of being ""shy"" even though i keep telling him that i have very many screws loose in my head. the intrusive thought to jump the fuck out of his car one day and hope i just get run over at a freeway only grows stronger day by day. i want to let the thought win by now because everyone but him seems to know something isn't right with me. they don't realize nothing is right with me. i now have a rep for being a shitty person who deserves every single bit of misery that comes to them. every. single. fucking. bit. i don't want to appear on the news as a failed attempt. i just want to be put the fuck out like a forest fire that should have died the moment the spark hit the first tree. if any of my relatives show up at my funeral and start doing everything but telling the truth about how i am, i would do everything to list in a possible will to never do it. i want them to tell any recollection of me as how they knew me. i know my mum would say i was a human being, flawed like any other person at least, which i think would be okay to say. i can't hope on anything for my father. i don't want him to even know if i died or not if it isn't his car doing the damage or something because he terrifies me with how borderline intrusive he gets with people sometimes. the shitty relative that indirectly turned me into a monster, even if he is dead, still abused me hella. he might have groomed me into almost getting raped. he said creepy shit because of my debilitating anxiety of even being seen outside of school, i found condoms in my room and found out he did it. i don't know if his wording of bathing naked at the hotel when i was 10 was intentional or not but his beady stare still haunts me two years after he died. i don't even have the feeling of autonomy and not feeling like i might be getting raped at this point because of people like him and another relative who might have molested me. my father blames me for being freaked out because the relative touched the inner part of my thigh when i was 12 even though i was incredibly distressed. i was 12. i kind of think i have every reason to hate my father for being an asshole when he told me i was overreacting to being harassed and extorted out of any sense of independence, with any attempt to do so leading to an early grave.

i was hospitalized in 2021 because i was a paranoid fuck, and now my body is giving up on me too. i was relatively ok in the head last year but then i got so sick by a literal stomach bug that i couldn't even drink water without wanting to throw up. even my body is telling me to drop dead, what more could i want? i've been bleeding out, coughing, my health is going down the shitter ever since i got covid. the only thing i had going for me to continue is gone, any chance of being healthy. if i was never happy, one should've at least been grateful for their health, and i have neither now. i go into fainting episodes, my breath gets fucked up without warning, even if it isn't a panic attack, and i can't remember shit. all of them are signs i have long covid and there's nothing i can do to stop it. don't even get me started on how shitty my ribs are. every other week i'm clinging onto them like i have some kind of internal bleeding problem, which i can only hope for instead of life being the sadistic asshole it's being to me. my legs started to give up on me. one by one, my system has been shutting down on me and all i can do is pray that it shuts down sooner than later. in fact, i just want it to end so bad, i start hoping i can get a stroke or get cancer. i deliberately put as much ash residue and secondhand smoke into my system to accelerate the chances of getting cancer, and am doing everything in my power to make myself increasingly sickly to die as soon as possible. unfortunately, those sadistic and masochistic bastards related to me keep trying to make me exist, even when i starve myself, even when i try to sleep forever. waking up becomes more disappointing than death, day by day.

every fucking day is terror. i don't know when i'll just be nuked anyways. i don't know when i'll be stabbed. i don't know when i'll be robbed. i recently realized my house already got an intruder case and i was the person who almost made it go from bad to worse when i was 12 so my area is just an absolute shithole as it was. i can't even say i live in a nice place when everywhere i look i risk taking a whiff of sewage or some homeless person's shit on the sidewalk. i was grateful to even leave in favor for somewhere like seattle, which people say is miles worse than the place i live in. i can't afford to go back, i worry my grandmother will just stalk me the way she threatened to stalk me when i was in my freshman year. it doesn't help that she has relatives there who can just give away where i might be hiding if i do get to go away from the hellhole i'm from and force me to come back to her anyways. i tried convincing my shitty grandmother to just fucking kill me already, and she didn't strangle me right then and there like i wanted to. since i last posted here, the situation has gotten so bad to the point that every time she talks to me i just want her to shut the fuck up even if i know she's hurt on the inside too. i have to force myself to not scream at her because it would just get me sent to the madhouse. again.

this is only the beginning of what i hope will be the end of this shithole. to tell the truth, ever since i started college, it's only gone down even worse. when i applied, i thought i was going to be rejected even though the college i somehow got accepted into doesn't reject people at all. i deserved to be rejected. i didn't even submit my transcripts because i almost failed my junior year. why did they let me in? i found out when i was in seattle but i wasn't happy, i was saddened that it would force me to live another day. i didn't deserve to be let in, even with those standards lower than the fucking ariana trench. i don't have the strength to continue to even exist. my work ethic is horrible, the mental illness is catching up to me as soon as i get out of some kind of shithole and it gets me closer to a death that should have happened 6 years ago. not to prove a point about how much assholery exists in this world. to prove a point that i genuinely should never have waken up ever again. every day is a day i shouldn't have waken up. i keep jumping between basically hibernating and being a literal vampire with no warning, which really doesn't help when the type of college homework i'm expected to do asks that i get a decent amount of sleep. i want to sleep in an eternal golden slumbers, but i can't stop jerking awake. it's not like it's too soon to go to sleep in that notion, the time i stayed in this world is a time spent far too long. i fumbled the ball with serendipity. i deserve every bit of pain i ever went through. to put insult to injury, my father started to force me to get a job when i got the fuck out of high school. i have no choice but to accept it because now i'm in a shitty financial situation where i don't even know if i'll be kicked out or forced to go away from the house again. i got rejected from 3 job offers, thought i had the ball secured on my first day at a coffee place i can't mention because they'll probably sue me. they didn't train me on my first day, then i was quietly fired behind my back, so i left feeling extra incompetent and ready to run into the street again. then, i ended up ACTUALLY landing a job somewhere else, and now i can't stop being inconsistent when i'm on the job. each shift makes me feel increasingly incompetent for every mistake i make and every time i fuck up to any sort of extent i fear being fired. i just got off my training wheels for it. i don't want to do this again and again. i'm so stupid, why do i keep screwing up like this? i deserve every bit of guilt i feel but i've lost any sense of sanity by this point that i start to fear having a stroke on the job from the irrepressible guilt i feel, and i have to hold back the thought to bash my head until my skull starts bleeding every time i keep getting interrupted or i have to deal with a shitty customer. i need the money to keep myself from being kicked out but i literally am running on thin ice with just about every single thing i can do, one way or another. the last straw for me was when i found out i can't attend classes because of the fact my college requires two orientations. i started to scream and try to smash my head into the concrete ground in my room, and was disappointed when i didn't bleed. my future is done for, so i have no reason to continue if my debilitating anxiety and depression makes it infuriating for me to even show up to these stupid fucking orientations. i did it to humor my father. i didn't want to exist anymore. it's even worse now and i'm even angrier than ever about it. i just wish i jump and never come back. i hope i never get rescued. i hope i never get found. i deserve to be a forgotten entity. i promised to be the last of the bloodline years ago when i found out it's a hereditary risk to be an asshole. it may seem like a pointless death, but i promise my death at this time is a sacrifice. my future is shot because of my long gone mental health, and i deserve to die because i'm stuck in an eternal loop that only gets others hurt for making me live any longer. nothing has ever worked, and i tried nearly everything i could to fix it. i hope they put me on dnr at this point.

when everyone is away. just, when everyone is away. when nobody knows i'm away. i'm jumping, or maybe drowning myself. i don't know when it's happening at this point. i just want to get it all over with. every single day i keep drifting between existing in an increasingly fragile feeling of false hopes and living in the miserable shithole that is my mind. my system is so desensitized to being boiled alive like soup to the point i consider dying of hyperthermia too on purpose. i had several close calls with the weather here that feels like an unchecked, nonstop oven shithole. i want to jump but i know i can't because i live in a claustrophobic shithole in general so if i did jump someone would try to get me the fuck away, much to my dismay and i have tried to be run over but that failed horribly too. i'm so desperate to just perish to the point that i might as well just attach a post-it on my back saying ""stab me"" or some shit and pray i don't get sent to the madhouse again. please don't tell me it isn't someone else that is causing this much anger. i know it's been 95% me since 2021.

when i'm gone, i hope nobody tries to reminisce on memories that had no chance in hell of existing. they should know i was a lost cause the moment they met me. i keep drifting in and out of suicide watch begging to be killed but my wishes are never fulfilled. my shitty relatives are trying to make me live longer than them even though i keep telling them to stop. i tried everything, but they don't care. they know i'm a shitty person who should die as soon as possible. why do they make it others' problems to deal with? i hope this is the ultimatum because i keep staring at the bridge i live nearby, thinking about doing it but never doing it because i know it's not going to work. someone is going to jump out of their car and force me to exist another painful 20 years. i know where i'll be in the next 10 years but i don't want it to be in the next 10 years. i want it to be as soon as possible. if they find my remains, i hope they just leave it there and never return it. every single bit of misery i did cannot be undone, and my death would do more people favors than burden them. i hope they tell it as it is if i die before enough people who know me now.",t2_7emrj96l,False,,0,False,i hope this is the final update i will ever have: i have no reason to continue.,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,,,0,,False,t3_12pb78y,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,False,,1681730197.0,,[],{},,True,,1681727806.0,text,,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;this shit is so fucking long if you read this literal clusterfuck, i commend you. it&amp;#39;s basically 18 years of suffering, with no sign of getting any better. maybe a shit ton more because even those troubles have centuries-long roots of issues. i don&amp;#39;t fucking know at this point. i&amp;#39;m so mad to the point that i became physically incapable of shutting the fuck up when i should&amp;#39;ve shut up 10 minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years ago.&lt;/p&gt;

do they know just what kind of emotional baggage they have to deal with if my bitchiness goes from wherever i live to seattle? i just wish they would wisen up and ban me the fuck out of that chance because this is all just karma for me being a total asshole. now that my shitty relative (who taught me to be the passive aggressive asshole i am today) died, i come to realize my father is the worst with being so fucking tonedeaf with my health. he pretends he cares for me then constantly blasts borderline misinformation about how people work, how society works, and i always get into arguments with him because of how much i hate his ideals and views on the world. our relationship is strained because i realized that he has been exploiting me for clout for years. for stupid instagram posts where i have to risk breaking my jaw for shit i have to force myself to exaggerate. he does it in public where people can see me, and it makes my situation go from bad to worse because it puts unwanted attention as well as possibly attracts creeps. he&amp;#39;s friends with people who genuinely make me feel sick even remembering and he&amp;#39;s happy that i can even remember them even if i associate them with something horrible. worst part about it is that i had been under said spotlight for several years and ANY fucking attempt of objection gets vetoed and i have to hold back the urge to jump out of the car and run away, never to be seen again, to hope his car won&amp;#39;t catch up with me, but to instead catch onto my shoelace and squash me the same way those stupid fucking posts he makes of me crushed my sanity like a hydraulic press. it&amp;#39;s not the only thing i realized he exploited me for. he made me do unpaid labor for about a month when i was in intermediate school over summer, shitty oppressive conditions at a hotel i cannot say for... reasons. i was a cleaner for the rooms and i had to work in shitty muggy conditions all the time without a chance of an AC and the reason it even came about was because he was super understaffed. insult to injury is that i didn&amp;#39;t even have a warning about it, one day, he just took me to the area, and i was super confused, and then i ended up in a warehouse full of rags, going back and forth between the hotel rooms. to this day, i get shivers down my spine whenever i even hear the hotel name mentioned, letalone read it anywhere. and worst of all, he always downplays my debilitating mental health issue. he keeps acting like the mildest thing, my lifelong social anxiety is a part of being &amp;quot;shy&amp;quot; even though i keep telling him that i have very many screws loose in my head. the intrusive thought to jump the fuck out of his car one day and hope i just get run over at a freeway only grows stronger day by day. i want to let the thought win by now because everyone but him seems to know something isn&amp;#39;t right with me. they don&amp;#39;t realize nothing is right with me. i now have a rep for being a shitty person who deserves every single bit of misery that comes to them. every. single. fucking. bit. i don&amp;#39;t want to appear on the news as a failed attempt. i just want to be put the fuck out like a forest fire that should have died the moment the spark hit the first tree. if any of my relatives show up at my funeral and start doing everything but telling the truth about how i am, i would do everything to list in a possible will to never do it. i want them to tell any recollection of me as how they knew me. i know my mum would say i was a human being, flawed like any other person at least, which i think would be okay to say. i can&amp;#39;t hope on anything for my father. i don&amp;#39;t want him to even know if i died or not if it isn&amp;#39;t his car doing the damage or something because he terrifies me with how borderline intrusive he gets with people sometimes. the shitty relative that indirectly turned me into a monster, even if he is dead, still abused me hella. he might have groomed me into almost getting raped. he said creepy shit because of my debilitating anxiety of even being seen outside of school, i found condoms in my room and found out he did it. i don&amp;#39;t know if his wording of bathing naked at the hotel when i was 10 was intentional or not but his beady stare still haunts me two years after he died. i don&amp;#39;t even have the feeling of autonomy and not feeling like i might be getting raped at this point because of people like him and another relative who might have molested me. my father blames me for being freaked out because the relative touched the inner part of my thigh when i was 12 even though i was incredibly distressed. i was 12. i kind of think i have every reason to hate my father for being an asshole when he told me i was overreacting to being harassed and extorted out of any sense of independence, with any attempt to do so leading to an early grave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i was hospitalized in 2021 because i was a paranoid fuck, and now my body is giving up on me too. i was relatively ok in the head last year but then i got so sick by a literal stomach bug that i couldn&amp;#39;t even drink water without wanting to throw up. even my body is telling me to drop dead, what more could i want? i&amp;#39;ve been bleeding out, coughing, my health is going down the shitter ever since i got covid. the only thing i had going for me to continue is gone, any chance of being healthy. if i was never happy, one should&amp;#39;ve at least been grateful for their health, and i have neither now. i go into fainting episodes, my breath gets fucked up without warning, even if it isn&amp;#39;t a panic attack, and i can&amp;#39;t remember shit. all of them are signs i have long covid and there&amp;#39;s nothing i can do to stop it. don&amp;#39;t even get me started on how shitty my ribs are. every other week i&amp;#39;m clinging onto them like i have some kind of internal bleeding problem, which i can only hope for instead of life being the sadistic asshole it&amp;#39;s being to me. my legs started to give up on me. one by one, my system has been shutting down on me and all i can do is pray that it shuts down sooner than later. in fact, i just want it to end so bad, i start hoping i can get a stroke or get cancer. i deliberately put as much ash residue and secondhand smoke into my system to accelerate the chances of getting cancer, and am doing everything in my power to make myself increasingly sickly to die as soon as possible. unfortunately, those sadistic and masochistic bastards related to me keep trying to make me exist, even when i starve myself, even when i try to sleep forever. waking up becomes more disappointing than death, day by day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;every fucking day is terror. i don&amp;#39;t know when i&amp;#39;ll just be nuked anyways. i don&amp;#39;t know when i&amp;#39;ll be stabbed. i don&amp;#39;t know when i&amp;#39;ll be robbed. i recently realized my house already got an intruder case and i was the person who almost made it go from bad to worse when i was 12 so my area is just an absolute shithole as it was. i can&amp;#39;t even say i live in a nice place when everywhere i look i risk taking a whiff of sewage or some homeless person&amp;#39;s shit on the sidewalk. i was grateful to even leave in favor for somewhere like seattle, which people say is miles worse than the place i live in. i can&amp;#39;t afford to go back, i worry my grandmother will just stalk me the way she threatened to stalk me when i was in my freshman year. it doesn&amp;#39;t help that she has relatives there who can just give away where i might be hiding if i do get to go away from the hellhole i&amp;#39;m from and force me to come back to her anyways. i tried convincing my shitty grandmother to just fucking kill me already, and she didn&amp;#39;t strangle me right then and there like i wanted to. since i last posted here, the situation has gotten so bad to the point that every time she talks to me i just want her to shut the fuck up even if i know she&amp;#39;s hurt on the inside too. i have to force myself to not scream at her because it would just get me sent to the madhouse. again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this is only the beginning of what i hope will be the end of this shithole. to tell the truth, ever since i started college, it&amp;#39;s only gone down even worse. when i applied, i thought i was going to be rejected even though the college i somehow got accepted into doesn&amp;#39;t reject people at all. i deserved to be rejected. i didn&amp;#39;t even submit my transcripts because i almost failed my junior year. why did they let me in? i found out when i was in seattle but i wasn&amp;#39;t happy, i was saddened that it would force me to live another day. i didn&amp;#39;t deserve to be let in, even with those standards lower than the fucking ariana trench. i don&amp;#39;t have the strength to continue to even exist. my work ethic is horrible, the mental illness is catching up to me as soon as i get out of some kind of shithole and it gets me closer to a death that should have happened 6 years ago. not to prove a point about how much assholery exists in this world. to prove a point that i genuinely should never have waken up ever again. every day is a day i shouldn&amp;#39;t have waken up. i keep jumping between basically hibernating and being a literal vampire with no warning, which really doesn&amp;#39;t help when the type of college homework i&amp;#39;m expected to do asks that i get a decent amount of sleep. i want to sleep in an eternal golden slumbers, but i can&amp;#39;t stop jerking awake. it&amp;#39;s not like it&amp;#39;s too soon to go to sleep in that notion, the time i stayed in this world is a time spent far too long. i fumbled the ball with serendipity. i deserve every bit of pain i ever went through. to put insult to injury, my father started to force me to get a job when i got the fuck out of high school. i have no choice but to accept it because now i&amp;#39;m in a shitty financial situation where i don&amp;#39;t even know if i&amp;#39;ll be kicked out or forced to go away from the house again. i got rejected from 3 job offers, thought i had the ball secured on my first day at a coffee place i can&amp;#39;t mention because they&amp;#39;ll probably sue me. they didn&amp;#39;t train me on my first day, then i was quietly fired behind my back, so i left feeling extra incompetent and ready to run into the street again. then, i ended up ACTUALLY landing a job somewhere else, and now i can&amp;#39;t stop being inconsistent when i&amp;#39;m on the job. each shift makes me feel increasingly incompetent for every mistake i make and every time i fuck up to any sort of extent i fear being fired. i just got off my training wheels for it. i don&amp;#39;t want to do this again and again. i&amp;#39;m so stupid, why do i keep screwing up like this? i deserve every bit of guilt i feel but i&amp;#39;ve lost any sense of sanity by this point that i start to fear having a stroke on the job from the irrepressible guilt i feel, and i have to hold back the thought to bash my head until my skull starts bleeding every time i keep getting interrupted or i have to deal with a shitty customer. i need the money to keep myself from being kicked out but i literally am running on thin ice with just about every single thing i can do, one way or another. the last straw for me was when i found out i can&amp;#39;t attend classes because of the fact my college requires two orientations. i started to scream and try to smash my head into the concrete ground in my room, and was disappointed when i didn&amp;#39;t bleed. my future is done for, so i have no reason to continue if my debilitating anxiety and depression makes it infuriating for me to even show up to these stupid fucking orientations. i did it to humor my father. i didn&amp;#39;t want to exist anymore. it&amp;#39;s even worse now and i&amp;#39;m even angrier than ever about it. i just wish i jump and never come back. i hope i never get rescued. i hope i never get found. i deserve to be a forgotten entity. i promised to be the last of the bloodline years ago when i found out it&amp;#39;s a hereditary risk to be an asshole. it may seem like a pointless death, but i promise my death at this time is a sacrifice. my future is shot because of my long gone mental health, and i deserve to die because i&amp;#39;m stuck in an eternal loop that only gets others hurt for making me live any longer. nothing has ever worked, and i tried nearly everything i could to fix it. i hope they put me on dnr at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when everyone is away. just, when everyone is away. when nobody knows i&amp;#39;m away. i&amp;#39;m jumping, or maybe drowning myself. i don&amp;#39;t know when it&amp;#39;s happening at this point. i just want to get it all over with. every single day i keep drifting between existing in an increasingly fragile feeling of false hopes and living in the miserable shithole that is my mind. my system is so desensitized to being boiled alive like soup to the point i consider dying of hyperthermia too on purpose. i had several close calls with the weather here that feels like an unchecked, nonstop oven shithole. i want to jump but i know i can&amp;#39;t because i live in a claustrophobic shithole in general so if i did jump someone would try to get me the fuck away, much to my dismay and i have tried to be run over but that failed horribly too. i&amp;#39;m so desperate to just perish to the point that i might as well just attach a post-it on my back saying &amp;quot;stab me&amp;quot; or some shit and pray i don&amp;#39;t get sent to the madhouse again. please don&amp;#39;t tell me it isn&amp;#39;t someone else that is causing this much anger. i know it&amp;#39;s been 95% me since 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when i&amp;#39;m gone, i hope nobody tries to reminisce on memories that had no chance in hell of existing. they should know i was a lost cause the moment they met me. i keep drifting in and out of suicide watch begging to be killed but my wishes are never fulfilled. my shitty relatives are trying to make me live longer than them even though i keep telling them to stop. i tried everything, but they don&amp;#39;t care. they know i&amp;#39;m a shitty person who should die as soon as possible. why do they make it others&amp;#39; problems to deal with? i hope this is the ultimatum because i keep staring at the bridge i live nearby, thinking about doing it but never doing it because i know it&amp;#39;s not going to work. someone is going to jump out of their car and force me to exist another painful 20 years. i know where i&amp;#39;ll be in the next 10 years but i don&amp;#39;t want it to be in the next 10 years. i want it to be as soon as possible. if they find my remains, i hope they just leave it there and never return it. every single bit of misery i did cannot be undone, and my death would do more people favors than burden them. i hope they tell it as it is if i die before enough people who know me now.&lt;/p&gt;

i held down a job for 6 years and worked my ass off to make the place better. i got fired for asking for my wage to be increased to the new minimum wage by the owners son who was a cop and was stealing from the business.

i got a new job where i was a manager making good money, but was fired by the new dm for 'harassing' him about installing fucking fire extinguishers in a place that already had two fires since i started working.osha ignored my calls and no lawyer will take my case.

they outlawed me being able to dress in drag in my state and are attempting to call it sexual assault on a minor if a child sees me in drag, which theyre trying to make punishable by the death penalty.

i cant even eat, they closed my food stamps account and wont answer my calls.

i tried to make things up in my life by doordashing nonstop, but then the cosigner of my car assaulted me and dragged me across a parking lot with her car, and stole my license plate. the police deemed her the victim somehow even tho shes still harassing me and has admitted to be working with the ex who is having my baby. no lawyer will take my case.

all i even wanted to do with my life was make music, but ive never been stable enough or had enough money to get the equipment. i made some songs using my phone and got a gig offering at a club but couldnt take it because i dont have equipment.

I don't have a degree nor do I have the luxury of investing in one. I can't go to college and also pay for what keeps a roof over my head. I can't accept scholarships, grants or financial aide, since the school program I got in pretty much fucked my chances up.

You can't even do anything! You just have to reiterate company policy, knowing it fucking sucks, and telling the higher ups things need to change won't fucking do anything.

What&amp;#39;s the point? Like genuinely. I did EXACTLY what I was told to do. I reached out. I &amp;quot;got help&amp;quot;. And what did that get me? A deeper hole to try and dig myself out of and being listed as a crazy pet by everyone I know. I genuinely believe this is the universe telling me what I need to do. It&amp;#39;s screaming at me to let go. If things were going to get better by now something, even the most minor thing, would have happened. For some people life never gets better. It&amp;#39;s just a slog until you pass. And I believe I fall in that category. I&amp;#39;m not gonna let myself get to 50 only to realize I should have been gone a long time ago. Who even knows if we&amp;#39;ll be here that long the way everything is going. I think I&amp;#39;m gonna take off work tomorrow and just give myself one last day of peace. And hopefully this time it sticks.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"So there is this guy, who I dated for some time and honestly I fell in love INCREDIBLY hard, I really REALLY loved him, he made me so happy and made forget all my struggles. As time went on, however, my mental issues started to leak into the relationship, long story short, he broke up with me and among the many things he said, he said that he never felt loved or that I didn't pay him enough attention and care, that he didn't feel listened. At the time I was going completely insane, my worst fear became true (the days leading up to this event I somehow realized that I fucked up and wanted to apologize and try to fix anything before it breaks but it was too late). Because my fear became true I started saying a lot of stupid fucking shit that I regret, things that made everything much worse. At one point I managed to convince him to take some time between us, and maybe return as friends or even a couple again, but after an hour or two of that, I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT MY FUCKING IMPULSIVE BRAIN DECIDED TO SEND HIM A MESSAGE WITH THOUSANDS OF WORDS SAYING HOW MAD I WAS AT HIM FOR THAT AND PAINTING MYSELF AS THE VICTIM, I FUCKING HATE MYSELF FOR DOING THAT FOR BEING SUCH A GASLIGHTNING PIECE OF SHIT, I said many many MANY things that made the situation MUCH MUCH MUCH worse, he left it on read. A few days later after cooling down I realized that YEAH HE WAS RIGHT, that whole situation was a clear example of me not listening to him and ignoring his needs, the whole situation was about him feeling like shit because of me and yet there I was writing that fucking thing. So I called him crying telling him all the things I've fucked up and how much of a piece of shit of a person I was, and that he was right. So again, somehow he decided to take a break instead of erasing me from his life, and we made a deal that he, once he felt well, would communicate with me in 2, 3 or whatever months.

Fine, that happened around mid March, so almost everyday since then I've been feeling guilty, it isn't the first time I've hurt someone because I lacked self-awareness (in fact around that time someone I knew had his relationship almost terminated because of something I did). I tried you know, I tried to change I don't like being a horrible person and yet I still hurt others or I come across as an arrogant piece of shit when meeting new people, I am so socially inept it's incredible. But anyway, I was feeling like shit for a whole month, I have had a hard time falling asleep because I keep ruminating about how terrible I was to him, I even had dreams about him. So I just couldn't hold it together anymore and decided to talk to him again today, I DON'T KNOW WHY THE FUCK DID I DO THAT LIKE WHY THE FUCK DID I DO THAT, I broke the deal we made because I was feeling desperate and needed to know he would forgive me, I NEEDED AND I SWEAR THAT I NEED TO KNOW IF I DID SOMETHING RIGHT, LIKE I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF HE WAS OKAY AND TALK A BIT AND MAKE SURE THAT IT DIDN'T END IN BAD TERMS, AND THAT AMONG ALL THE SHIT I'VE CAUSED THERE WAS SOMETHING GOOD, I WANTED TO KNOW IF HE WAS HAPPY AT LEAST ONCE WITH ME, IF I DID THE RIGHT THING ONCE, I tried so hard during the relationship to be a nice person and I just couldn't, even with the best of intentions I ended up hurting him. He answered the message an hour later, and he pretty much told me to fuck off, that I, once again, have proven that I don't listen to him, that I ignore his feelings. This break was for him, not for me, and I decided to ignore the deal because I was selfish and desperate to know if he was okay. He told me ""How can we start from scratch if you cannot even do one thing right and keep the promise we made?"". Now there is a good chance that he will never talk to me again, or that if we ever do, it won't be the same, in his eyes I am a complete piece of garbage. I swear I didn't want to do that and now I have hurt someone again, I didn't want to break the promise just for the sake of breaking it I didn't want to hurt him again, I've always tried to be the best for him and listen to him and do everything, I really wanted to keep our promise but my mental health and immaturity fucked everything again.

I just don't know why should I bother with anything, ever since fucking highschool I've been a piece of shit and hated by everyone, after this I can't even look my friends in the eyes (my ex and me share the same group of people). I remember telling one of my friends how scared I was of hurting my boyfriend, how scared I was of being a piece of shit again, and I promised to him that I'd do anything in order to make him happy and yet here we are, I did end up hurting him. He had so many horrible past experiences and even trauma with his multiple ex, I was scared I would become yet another shitty experience that would fuel his own mental health issues, and now I might be, he might never date again, I don't know, I am really afraid I ruined him, I am afraid I might have ruined any future potential relation he would have. 

I hate myself so much, he did so much for me, he truly made me happier than ever before. He rekindled my love for music, my love for drawing and arts, he did so much for me and I, in return, only fueled his traumas and made him feel like shit, even now, even now he still doesn't feel listened for what I did a few  hours ago, I disappointed him again. He even told me he thought I've learnt from my mistakes and that he even started missing talking to me AND I RUINED EVERYTHING.

I really should kill myself, I just can't live with this guilt, I really can't do it anymore. No matter how aware I become of the fact that I am a garbage human being, I can't seem to change, even when I want to help people I end up hurting them. 

Why am I so emotionally immature? Why do I lack so much self-awareness? I swear, I tried my best, I really did. I tried so hard to make him happy and yet, why? Why am I like this? Why can't I be like most people and either just move on or grow as a person? I really only had good intentions but I always find a way to ruin everything. He was really scared at one point I'd kill myself, that was one thing about me that messed him up, he was crying when he learnt how suicidal I really am. I also remember telling him that I was afraid I'd hurt him in some way, but he said that we are adults, he knows how to avoid or put a stop to behaviours like that. And yet here we are.

Will I ever be a good person? I want to be one, and I tried hard to start doing the right thing with him but I fucked it up. I am so done, I am afraid therapy won't even work now, this guilt I feel is quite literally killing me.

tl;dr: I ruined a relation with someone who was very very special to me and ended up hurting him despite my efforts for the contrary, twice, I am paranoid that I might have left him scarred just like his previous ex's. And now my guilt is killing me so bad that I am once again on the verge of attempting suicide.",t2_w5wxl0cm,False,,0,False,"no matter how hard I try I keep acting like a douchebag and keep ruining people, do i even deserve to live if i am such a terrible individual?",[],r/SuicideWatch,False,,,0,,False,t3_12p9utp,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1681724496.0,text,,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So there is this guy, who I dated for some time and honestly I fell in love INCREDIBLY hard, I really REALLY loved him, he made me so happy and made forget all my struggles.

&lt;p&gt;Fine, that happened around mid March, so almost everyday since then I&amp;#39;ve been feeling guilty, it isn&amp;#39;t the first time I&amp;#39;ve hurt someone because I lacked self-awareness (in fact around that time someone I knew had his relationship almost terminated because of something I did). I tried you know, I tried to change I don&amp;#39;t like being a horrible person and yet I still hurt others or I come across as an arrogant piece of shit when meeting new people, I am so socially inept it&amp;#39;s incredible. But anyway, I was feeling like shit for a whole month, I have had a hard time falling asleep because I keep ruminating about how terrible I was to him, I even had dreams about him. So I just couldn&amp;#39;t hold it together anymore and decided to talk to him again today, I DON&amp;#39;T KNOW WHY THE FUCK DID I DO THAT LIKE WHY THE FUCK DID I DO THAT, I broke the deal we made because I was feeling desperate and needed to know he would forgive me, I NEEDED AND I SWEAR THAT I NEED TO KNOW IF I DID SOMETHING RIGHT, LIKE I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF HE WAS OKAY AND TALK A BIT AND MAKE SURE THAT IT DIDN&amp;#39;T END IN BAD TERMS, AND THAT AMONG ALL THE SHIT I&amp;#39;VE CAUSED THERE WAS SOMETHING GOOD, I WANTED TO KNOW IF HE WAS HAPPY AT LEAST ONCE WITH ME, IF I DID THE RIGHT THING ONCE, I tried so hard during the relationship to be a nice person and I just couldn&amp;#39;t, even with the best of intentions I ended up hurting him. He answered the message an hour later, and he pretty much told me to fuck off, that I, once again, have proven that I don&amp;#39;t listen to him, that I ignore his feelings. This break was for him, not for me, and I decided to ignore the deal because I was selfish and desperate to know if he was okay. He told me &amp;quot;How can we start from scratch if you cannot even do one thing right and keep the promise we made?&amp;quot;. Now there is a good chance that he will never talk to me again, or that if we ever do, it won&amp;#39;t be the same, in his eyes I am a complete piece of garbage. I swear I didn&amp;#39;t want to do that and now I have hurt someone again, I didn&amp;#39;t want to break the promise just for the sake of breaking it I didn&amp;#39;t want to hurt him again, I&amp;#39;ve always tried to be the best for him and listen to him and do everything, I really wanted to keep our promise but my mental health and immaturity fucked everything again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t know why should I bother with anything, ever since fucking highschool I&amp;#39;ve been a piece of shit and hated by everyone, after this I can&amp;#39;t even look my friends in the eyes (my ex and me share the same group of people). I remember telling one of my friends how scared I was of hurting my boyfriend, how scared I was of being a piece of shit again, and I promised to him that I&amp;#39;d do anything in order to make him happy and yet here we are, I did end up hurting him. He had so many horrible past experiences and even trauma with his multiple ex, I was scared I would become yet another shitty experience that would fuel his own mental health issues, and now I might be, he might never date again, I don&amp;#39;t know, I am really afraid I ruined him, I am afraid I might have ruined any future potential relation he would have. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate myself so much, he did so much for me, he truly made me happier than ever before. He rekindled my love for music, my love for drawing and arts, he did so much for me and I, in return, only fueled his traumas and made him feel like shit, even now, even now he still doesn&amp;#39;t feel listened for what I did a few  hours ago, I disappointed him again. He even told me he thought I&amp;#39;ve learnt from my mistakes and that he even started missing talking to me AND I RUINED EVERYTHING.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really should kill myself, I just can&amp;#39;t live with this guilt, I really can&amp;#39;t do it anymore. No matter how aware I become of the fact that I am a garbage human being, I can&amp;#39;t seem to change, even when I want to help people I end up hurting them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why am I so emotionally immature? Why do I lack so much self-awareness? I swear, I tried my best, I really did. I tried so hard to make him happy and yet, why? Why am I like this? Why can&amp;#39;t I be like most people and either just move on or grow as a person? I really only had good intentions but I always find a way to ruin everything. He was really scared at one point I&amp;#39;d kill myself, that was one thing about me that messed him up, he was crying when he learnt how suicidal I really am. I also remember telling him that I was afraid I&amp;#39;d hurt him in some way, but he said that we are adults, he knows how to avoid or put a stop to behaviours like that. And yet here we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will I ever be a good person? I want to be one, and I tried hard to start doing the right thing with him but I fucked it up. I am so done, I am afraid therapy won&amp;#39;t even work now, this guilt I feel is quite literally killing me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tl;dr: I ruined a relation with someone who was very very special to me and ended up hurting him despite my efforts for the contrary, twice, I am paranoid that I might have left him scarred just like his previous ex&amp;#39;s. And now my guilt is killing me so bad that I am once again on the verge of attempting suicide.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I’m 28, married and I feel depressed. I can’t talk about this to anyone. I refuse to. So I choose to post here just to get rid of the weight in my chest.

I always have suicidal thoughts but I never told anyone. My marriage is failing. Me and my SO promised before that we won’t end up like our parents (both are separated and don’t care about us anymore) So we’re building everything from scratch by ourselves.

He supports me, but I can’t get emotional support from him. Especially when I need it now the most. I’m 32 weeks pregnant and I wanted to die more than during the first few months of my pregnancy. We fight a lot. He has a short temper and doesn’t do well in figuring out how he feels. He gets mad then says things like “you’re on your own” “I’ve given everything I had so I can’t give anything more to you” I always feel I’m never good enough for him because he gets mad of something I didn’t intentionally do or forgot (being human)

I always tell him not to decide when upset. Because what he says hurts me. I think it’s his pride. He covers everything by being rude to me.

I feel like I have to be good at everything, not make a mistake and always meet his expectations or else he’ll says things like that once I upset him. I feel his love is conditional, which is not what I want, especially we’re building a family.

I’m unhappy. He can sleep soundly while I’m hurt and when we’re not okay. He doesn’t want to talk about the problem because he thinks I think he has no right to get mad because I cry everytime it happens. That I invalidate his feelings. He refuses to communicate. All I want to do is understand him but his manpride doesn’t allow himself to be vulnerable. Instead of talking his feelings he’ll say hurtful things like he’s fed up, he’s tired of doing things for us and wants to do something for himself and wants to quit doing what we do.

I don’t think I invalidate his feelings. It’s just that he needs to control it because he decides and says things while he’s emotional and it kills me. I feel like I failed because I wanted a family. But it’s impossible to get that now so I just want a restart my life for failing the choices I made for this one.

Yea. I wanted a kennel. He helped me. But once he gets mad he says things like if I don’t know how to manage one just sell the dogs, then the next day when he’s not emotional, he’ll say it’s okay, at least you’re learning. He says he will help me but once he didn’t like something or I made a mistake he says I’m on my own.

I’m literally growing a human right now. But it’s like it’s nothing to him. Like it’s normal. We also have work. 8 hours each. But once he gets mad, he’ll abandon work. So that means I have to catch up the hours he missed, so I nesd to work all 16 hours. And I had to do everything by myself because he’ll stay in bed and watch reels while calming down. I’m jealous how he can abandon things when he feels emotional when I have to clean up the dishes and continue working after I feel hurt after he said. I don’t have time for leisure. I constantly think about my baby, our kennel, our work, house budget, chores and stuff. If only I could do everything by myself I would, but I couldn’t. 24 hours a day isn’t enough. And I couldn’t abandon myself because I have a baby.

I want to get away. But I can’t trust the dogs to him because I know he’ll abandon them when he’s upset. Basically, when he’s upset I have to do everything until he comes back to his senses, which is tiring. It’s like having a teenager.

I feel guilty for crying, for getting hurt, for not sleeping when my body needs it, and for staying up late. Because I think I’m hurting my baby. I want to die, but her little kicks tell me she wants to live. That’s why I plan to leave after getting her out.

It’s pointless to fix a marriage when only one wants to fix it. I feel like there’s something stabbing on my chest. It feels so heavy. I feel so hurt and the only way to get rid of it is to fix this (which I think is impossible) or die. I’m so tired of being the person who shouldn’t get tired. I’m tired of dreaming for us and workung hard to achieve it when it’s so easy for him to abandon everything.

since being in contact with her again shes changed a lot, of course I have too but hers is just.. really depressing.
She's always struggled with body image but she was still comfortable enough to take photos with me and let me post them etc but recently it just seems so different.

i get worried taking photos of her because i know she's immediately going to reply with some varient of ""i look so fat/ugly/greasy!!"" and i never know how to respond? Since i last saw her shes easily lost 30-40lbs and is now VERY obviously underweight yet still wont let me post any of our PROFESSIONAL PHOTOSHOOT PICTURES because ""her proportions look weird""...

I've personally struggled with eating disorders and self harm a lot throughout ages around 12-14 and I had to really push myself to recover and take the correct meds etc, during these past few years ive never had any urges to self harm or restrict calories etc. until recently 

since becoming friends with M again its started making me feel awful about my body.. she talks about herself like shes HUGE &amp; i know obviously her dysmorphia/ED doesn't affect how she sees ME but hearing this knowing i weigh around 50lbs more (im still in healthy BMI range) really hurts my feelings, i feel huge next to her especially when in the past our weight difference was barely noticable (and she regularly talks about how 'disgustingly obese' her pre-weightloss body was)

I tried to communicate witth her that this kinda upsets me but she seemed to be annoyed with me and said she was ""going offline to sleep"" the moment i tried to nicely mention it. I always try to support her, i never ask about what shes eating or make body comments etc and ill always pay for her food if i can or eat with her but i just feel like shes forgotten i also used to struggle with EDS &amp; body image?

she always says my body is perfect and she thinks i dont need to loose any weight etc but it still really fucking hurts hearing all this, i dont know what im supposed to do to help her in this situation ? her family already know and i feel like a awful friend for being triggered instead of 'fixing' her problems.

,SuicideWatch,"I've realized I'm just in a constant cycle of getting suicidal, calling the hotline and getting disappointed, and then making a post on here hoping it'll somehow help me. This is an alt account and yet at this point I'm more active in this account compared to my main account. This is just a toxic cycle that helps no one. 

I just call the suicide hotline and talk to them until the conversation goes no where, with them giving me advice I've already heard and try or just giving me empty platitudes. I know it's not a perfect service and it can definitely help others, but it can't help me anymore. I then make a post on here like this one just hoping to talk to someone, but even then I'm not satisfied. Sometimes people reach out and ask me what's wrong so I tell them, they give me advice and most of the time I've already tried it. After that, they just stop responding after some time since it's clear their time is just being wasted. Thing is that I at least enjoyed talking to someone, it's just not enough for me to stop wishing for my own death.

I wish I had someone to talk to about anything, not just about these desires but just talk about our days or what's been bugging us, or any plans we have. However, I know that's not possible at the moment and it's just because of me. I can't keep any online friends because of my busy life but my busy life makes me want to die the most painful death imaginable just to have some peace. My friends want to help me but it's only because they want the feeling of having saved someone and don't actually want to help me if it's too much work. Not their fault, it's my fault and my problems, not theirs. 

They say that 9/10 suicides could have been prevented had they gotten the help, it seems like I'm not part of that 9/10 since 'help' hasn't actually helped me. I've tried, but ultimately there is no perfect cure to this and I feel like I'm being a burden to those who try to help me. I'm sorry, I tried.

,SuicideWatch,"Hey everyone!
It's my first time here...
It's kind of akward to use this platform to input my thoughts but here goes nothing...

I've been in mental hospitals 4 times now. They are all related to suicide thoughts and attempts. It been 6 months since my last hospitalization and I feel like I need a break from society again. A lot of suicide thoughts, lately. Maybe for a month now and they are growing and becoming worse and worse every single day. I don't even want to go to work and the fact that I have to deal with people at work everyday makes me so anxious that I just want to hit and run. Sometimes, I think about running away and starting all over at a different place but yeah... money issues. 

I wished mental health was accessible (money wise) but it's not. I have this huge bill because my insurance did not cover anything and now I can't afford therapy anymore due to the sum of this bill and my last hospitalization. It's almost 30k. Why is everything so expensive? Do they really want us to be sane? I feel like I'm losing my sanity right now. 

I lost my will to life on my last attempt and the only thing that is keeping me on track is this idea that I want to live but why do I want to live, is it because someone else wants me to or is it due to my own conviction? I'm not even sure anymore... What I'm sure is that my death is not going to change anything in this  world nor me being alive will either. I'm just hopeless, broken, empty and pathetic,  at this point.

I feel stuck, I can't afford therapy nor another hospitalization. My liberty is restricted, I can't do anything that can put myself at harm because they have been removed and there are other ways that I have access but I don't have the guts yet. I feel lonely and that no ones understands me. Also, no one helps me either. Every time I ask a friend to go out with me because I'm too insecure  or anxious to go out by myself, they just simply ditched me. So yeah...

Every day I struggle with the idea of being alive. Waking up is so hard and getting out of bed is even worse. I have this internal battle where I question myself if getting up is worth it, if working is something worth doing or if being alive is actually useful. I lost my visions, my ambitions, my will to do anything (hobbies, go out with friends or by myself, taking care of my puppy, etc).

Guys...
I'm exhausted. I don't think I can keep one more day with this. I'm trapped on this never-ending cycle that I am the only one that can stopped it but I can't.

,SuicideWatch,"So I don't know if anyone has brought up this point when it comes to suicide but it needs to be said. To preface I feel and grieve for those lost by suicide and hope for the best for those still here. 

Anyway, I notice a lot of platitudes that sound dumb in reality and feel more like an emotional reaction than anything. For example. People usually say things like think about you family or loved ones and how poeple will have to deal with your dead body. I've even seen a comment once where someone felt some type of way because they saw a victim at a hospital. 

Now I am by no mean dismissing people experiences or those bereaved. However, it is odd to me. What if the person has: no family, a bad/toxic/abusive/neglectful/ignorant family, lack of QUALITY support, no treatment options and/or money, a chronic illness, and/or no friends (or at least close friends. It's just weird that I would have to care about random people who couldn't bat an eye or give me the light of day but then magically be grieving over someone they never truly had. They just lost my prescience and existence. And this is assuming the person even is noticed in day to day life.

Another one is ""It's the easy way out"" or ""permanent solution to temporary problem"". First, why wouldn't I want an easier way. Some people have it hard enough as is, if there is an easier way why not? That doesn't make it any more or less negative and it really shows how people value strength over mental health and well being. For the second, why wouldn't someone want a permanent solution even if the problem is temporary? Let's say I have an infestation. Even if it would eventually go away, would I want a permanent solution to the issue or a temporary one? Exactly. And temporary doesn't equal easy or devastating.

To preface I feel and grieve for those lost by suicide and hope for the best for those still here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I notice a lot of platitudes that sound dumb in reality and feel more like an emotional reaction than anything. For example. People usually say things like think about you family or loved ones and how poeple will have to deal with your dead body. I&amp;#39;ve even seen a comment once where someone felt some type of way because they saw a victim at a hospital. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I am by no mean dismissing people experiences or those bereaved. However, it is odd to me. What if the person has: no family, a bad/toxic/abusive/neglectful/ignorant family, lack of QUALITY support, no treatment options and/or money, a chronic illness, and/or no friends (or at least close friends.

,SuicideWatch,"hey y'all

stuck with a lovely combo of bipolar 2, ADHD, and alcoholism. all kindly passed down from generations before me :,). the last one is the real source of majority of my recent problems.

,SuicideWatch," 

hello,

I've never vented online to complete strangers before, so sorry if this is really rambly, but I thought I'd give it a shot...

I'm 20 years old, female, (not sure if that matters but)... I still live at home with my parents rent free.

I've had a really good life. My family is upper middle class, I've never had to worry about food on the table, not having new clothes or supplies for the school year, etc. I have a wonderful and loving mother, but my dad is the unavailable type. He's there, but that's it. Every time we talk he's beating me down verbally, calling me names, telling me I did something wrong. If he wasn't doing any of that, we just didn't talk at all. We only acknowledged each other's existence from time to time (daddy issues... who saw that one coming?) He's gotten better, but the severe damage to our relationship has been done. I have no desire to fix it, I've already tried to no avail, I think it's fair I gave up on that. The only time he shows love is through money. (Randomly giving me money for clothes, food, to spend time with friends, even though I never ever ask.)

I never had to work hard in life. Ever. I never cared about school, I always did just enough to pass. But now, I'm in community college (online) because I needed to raise my GPA to get into actual college, and if anything I only made my GPA worse. I'm on academic probation cuz I've failed three classes and I'm on my way to fail another one again. I was supposed to have my associates by now. I just can't get started, it physically hurts to, idk how to explain it. I see I have an assignment, tell myself I'll do it, I don't, next thing I know it's three months later and there's no point in trying because I basically already failed. I get so behind that I give up before even trying, and that's no ones fault but my own, I know that. I'm not blaming anyone but myself here.

Another important note is that I have no desire to eat (one time when I was 8 I passed out because I didn't eat for so long and my mom only got mad at me lmao, but what I'm saying is, is that it's always been a problem. An overlooked one I think.) I was fine for a while, intuitively eating (eating when I felt hungry), but more often than not, I'd forget to eat, so I wouldn't. Then I'd be too lazy to eat, so I wouldn't. Then I felt like I hadn't earned the food my parents pay for, so I wouldn't. Now, years and years of unknowingly decreasing my calorie intake has taken its toll on my body and I feel sick to my stomach when I think of food. I can only have a couple bites before I'm full or feeling too sick to finish my meal. If I could assume, I have about 600ish calories a day. Maybe even less now. My BMI is 16.4 as of now, and honestly, I feel like even that is too high of a number to be considered an issue. I'm still breathing aren't I? It was never a vanity thing, I'm already naturally skinny and I never cared about my body much, I just have a messed up relationship with food.

Basically, I'm a failure. I know I'm only 20 and people will say I have my whole life ahead of me, and technically, I do, but to me, I've already failed. I have no interest in relationships, children, career, money, nothing. I don't want to do anything. I don't even want to move. Perhaps it's the crushing thought of ""I'm not capable of doing anything, and I'm so afraid of trying and failing that I'd rather not try at all."" or ""Even if I do all the things that make a person successful, I still won't be happy."" maybe even ""Is my only purpose in life to get a good paying job and then spend the money to make more money because the entire purpose of being human is to make money?"" that's holding me back from becoming a better person.

I've convinced myself that this is as far as I'm meant to go. My dad always asks me where I see myself in 5 years, and when I think of just next month, I see nothing. Just black.

Dare I say it, I'm a bit suicidal. Am I allowed to say that here? It started off as ideation, but now I have this idea in my head that I'm going to live this summer like my last one, because it will be, and when the end of August rolls around, my room and belongings will be organized, I'll have written my notes, then go outside, call the police to let them know where they can find and dispose of my body, and do it. Peacefully, in the sun, in the grass, away from people so no one would have to find me like that.

School is exhausting, talking is exhausting, eating is exhausting, sleeping is exhausting, everything is exhausting. And I hate feeling that way because there are people that would kill to be in my shoes, but here I am complaining. If I could, I'd crawl out of my body and give it to someone who deserves it. Truly, I would.

I'm an anxious wreck, everything terrifies me. The stress, fear, and lack of food has made me sleepy every single day without fail. Even when I'm awake, I feel like I'm asleep. I've grown a notorious for my lack of energy. It's miserable. I always feel nauseous. Sick. So so so tired.

My room is a mess, and I mean a MESS. I know how to make gnat traps when it gets really bad (already had to do it once this year, and when they showed up I took care of them after a week or so of living with them of course. Rotting food left in the corner of my room and all that.) I only shower if I have to, only brush my hair if I have to, only brush my teeth and wash my clothes if I have to. Only eat if I absolutely have to. Just like with school, I do the bare minimum to be keep myself alive and pass a functioning human being, but I don't want to do any of it anymore.

I don't deserve to be alive, I don't deserve to die, I don't deserve to have it so easy, I don't deserve to have or be anything.

I just, don't see a way out. There's nothing left for me. I had a good life, it's good enough for me. I'm just so tired of being scared. I'm tired of being tired. I don't want to do anything. I just want to sleep.",t2_56omih7wy,False,,0,False,"i dont deserve to live, i dont deserve to die",[],r/SuicideWatch,False,,,0,,False,t3_12p1cuk,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1681704352.0,text,,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;hello,&lt;/p&gt;

Anyways, since I was 4 I've felt a lot of fear, anxiety and stress. I was a sad kid and don't really know why, I grew up being a sad, shy, introverted teen with little to none self-esteem nor social skills (my mom thought I was autistic, but never checked because she was too embarrassed, I don't think I am tho). I was a (repressed) gay girl that grew up in a poor, close-minded family, in a 3th world country. In the first chance I got I moved to a different country, thinking it would make things better. And it did get better, I got a room, a job and (surprisingly) a girlfriend. Life was feeling less like an endless life or death battle. 

I managed to fuck things up somehow, my gf (now ex) fell in love with someone else, and since I'm barely social the only friends I had, were her friends. Now they're all gone. And I'm feeling nothing but sadness and emptiness. For me, life lost its meaning a long time ago. Didn't get to finish college back in my country bc I never really was any good at learning stuff, maybe it's something about my IQ, maybe I'm just used to being overwhelmed and can't cope with exams, I don't really know. So I'm stuck in a sucky job, awful overpriced apartment that can't even pay for myself, no friends, no family, different country, no gf and no motivations.

I don't understand people, I don't understand social protocols, I can't stop my brain from thinking a thousand different things per minute and I can't stop hating myself.

,SuicideWatch,"I don't think anyone is actually worried, but incase you are, don't worry I won't kill myself. I have tried it before, but just contemplating it is a coping mechanism for me. Besides that, I don't want her to feel guilty for the rest of her life wondering if pity-dating me could've saved me.

Also, fair warning, reading this is not worth your time.

About two weeks ago my girlfriend broke up with me. It wasn't all that heartbreaking at first because I thought we'd end up fine, but over the past week it has become increasingly apparent that I won't end up with her.

We were in a long distance relationship, but a two hour flight was not unmanageable. We'd spend weeks together and then weeks apart. This put some strain on us. 

She was going to spend all summer at my place, and I was looking forwards to it so much. I was telling all my friends about it, all my coworkers knew about it. My life is very stressful most of the time but I felt so glad I could spend it with her for the time being. I felt so relieved.

I was secretly in love with her for a couple years before we started dating. She was my best friend despite us only talking online. When she first came to my city she stayed over at my place and we immediately saw that it could work between us.

We did so many fun things together, we are so alike in so many ways. She is beautiful and I felt so over the moon that she was my girlfriend. I was never a better fit to anyone in my entire life.

Now it is all over though.

It felt surreal at first, but now it has started to hit me. I have an incredibly important job, and an increasing amount of responsibility, but I can't even get out of the house anymore. Sometimes I'll be doing any task and I am just hit with a wave of sadness that will make me lay down on the floor. I can't work like this. I no longer have any apetite, and when I try to eat it feels like my mouth is too tired to chew and my throat too dry to swallow. I can't sleep anymore. Sometimes I get the urge to cry but I can't, so my heart just starts pounding out of my chest and my hands start shaking.

The most sad songs I have ever heard keep looping in my head, memories play in my head from moments that made me feel so fulfilled, but now I can only feel a giant cavity – a giant cavity where a smaller version of me runs around with tears in his eyes, punching and stabbing everything around him in an act of desperation. Weird, I know.

I am so bad with breakups. I have gone through things that are so, so much worse. This is however the worst feeling I have ever had, akin to a person very close to me dying.

I just wish I could sleep through it all. Every little thing in my life reminds me of her. I want to feel the love I once felt. I want to be really busy at work, and seeing her text me that she loves me and misses me so I can ride that high throughout the day, just like the old days.

Instead as my usual coping mechanism I just keep having a vision on loop of me putting a gun to my cranium and a bullet traveling through my brain with the gases expelled from the barrel blowing everything inside out.

I won't do it, but the thought that such an option always exists relieves some pressure.

I don't know what to do. She wants to remain friends, but I just hate seeing her move on in life without me. Feeling someone's love for you fade away is the most agonizing feeling there is to me. I keep having all these feelings weighing on me. 

Atleast I can share them here without bothering her.

Smrodek, I love you so fucking much.

I know this entire post is incoherent rambling but I just want to get it off my chest. I have been doing all the things I am supposed to do like not contacting her, working out, seeing friends, going outside... it just doesn't work for me. The last girl who broke up with me dated me for two months and we weren't even officially together. That took me almost 5 months to get over even though I wasn't as remotely attached to her or in love. This can very well take me a year to get over at least.

I am mortified of her reading this. I didn't use her name and posted this from an alt account, but I am still very worried of her finding out how poorly I am doing while she doesn't seem that bothered by it. In a couple weeks, maybe 3 she'll be fine. That's okay, I don't wish for her to go through this.

I just think that me feeling like this is very offputting and me becoming a subject of pity will erase any good memories we have together. 

I will genuinely never meet anyone as good of a match for me as she was ever again, and even if I did, I'd be so terrified to go through this again.

Right now I am just tossing and turning in my bed. It's always raining in my head and I can't get the taste of vomit out of my mouth. 

I can't fall asleep, I have to keep myself occupied until I pass out. I want to be violent until my body gives out so I can truly feel like I did everything I could.

Despite hanging out with friends the past couple days, I haven't smiled at all until a man threatened to kill me today (I do not live in a very good neighbourhood). I told him to shut the fuck up but I smirked when I walked off and thought about what a wasted breath a death threat is to me.

That story is so incredibly cringey that I would never share it because it sounds like a made up fantasy, but I am comfortable doing it here because I don't think anyone will read this far down into my incoherent ramblings.

I've been writing this post for half an hour and it honestly helps. It doesn't take away from the fact that I am so desperate that I am sweating and shaking and starving over it, and that my alarm will ring in a couple hours after which I have to put on a suit and a smile and solve problems but for now, in this moment I feel slightly less bad being trapped with these thoughts.

I wish I could call in sick or take some time off but there is too much riding on me right now to do any of that. It's a very stressful job and because of the nature of it I am not allowed to talk about it to anyone.

My life in general is pretty stressful and a lot to maintain, and I'll admit I have been pretty nihilistic about life and not assigning any value to it at all for the past year, but she was my only reason to keep going. The reason everything felt right.

I just wish she missed me. I mean I guess she does but she doesn't express it. In a month we'll have a talk about getting back together, but honestly the writing is on the wall. If we do decide to get back together though, it would be a fresh start which would be nice.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi all,

This is my very first post on Reddit and I hope I can find help, advice and support.

I have been diagnosed with major depression disorder since November 2022. The doctor signed me for one week of short term disability leave. My employer and N+1 were aware of this and approved my leave.

I came back one week later and continued working as usual. Until that online 1:1 meeting in January 2023 when my manager told me in exactly one sentence that I was no longer part of the company, then he left the room and left me with someone from HR to go through my termination package. I asked the HR girl if there was a particular reason why they let me go (budget issues, mistakes that I could have made or whatnot) and she said it was a ""termination without cause.""

This made things considerably worse for my mental health, I started making research and plans RE: suicide and self-harm and eventually decided to order a packet of oleander seeds and take them with a glass of water. At the last moment, I contacted my family doctor who immediately referred me to the ER of my city's main mental health hospital. They kept me for a couple weeks and among other things, tried using ECT (electroconvulsive treatment) and MST (magnetic seizure therapy). I know both treatments worked miracles for some other patients, and that's wonderful. However, not only they didn't work on me, but they also caused some pretty bad memory loss, which is an expected side effect but causes major trouble, confusion and discomfort in my everyday life. For instance, I have more and more difficulty finding my words (English is not my mother tongue) and cannot communicate properly. One day I was chatting with my boyfriend's mom who asked me if I was using the blender that she gave me for Christmas. I had totally forgotten that she gave me a blender for Christmas. Entire parts of my life have disappeared into the void. My memory is supposed to be restored in 6 to 12 months, but somehow I feel like it's lost forever.

After I was discharged, things went up and down. I fought suicidal thoughts as hard as I could, forced myself to keep my mind busy with things that I used to enjoy such as playing the piano, knitting or watching anime, and sometimes it worked. But there are more and more nights when I cannot stop sobbing and staring at the tiny packet of oleander seeds in my cupboard.

I have a number of friends and relatives who brought me tons of love and help, not to mention my beloved puppy. My boyfriend has been a wonderful support but he is experiencing anxiety attacks because of me and I don't want to make him suffer further. At the same time I know very well that he and my other loved ones will be devastated if I attempt and succeed to take my own life. When I think about it, I really hate myself and feel selfish, heartless and broken.

The only ones I hate more than myself are the people at my company who knowingly decided my ""termination without cause"" at a time of my life when I was vulnerable. I want them to be held accountable for this, and if it's out of reach, at least to be aware of the damage they have done to my mental health and health in general. I am considering contacting a lawyer specialized in labor law to see if I can obtain justice, reparation or compensation of any kind. And I often fantasize about sending my ex-manager a text along the lines of ""I'm kicking the bucket, it's all your fault, I hope you're happy you bastard"" at the time that I'll swallow the seeds.

At this point I'll welcome any kind of advice and tips on how to manage this situation.

So, nothing particularly bad has happened today. Which makes me feel even worse than if I had a reason to feel horrible.


I just started to spiral into the self hate and depression that sometimes happens. Everything felt so pointless and painful. I will try to write out what I thought.


It all started with me thinking about starting home workout again after being unhappy with my body. I searched for a few exercises to do and then the intrusive thoughts began. ""Why even bother you're gonna look like shit anyways. You have no idea what you're doing. You're gonna do all the exercises wrong and look like a retart. As if you would ever do those regularly, you always give up like the loser you are.""

Initially that just got me to stop searching for them and drop my plan to work out. Instead I just showered and tried to drown out my thoughts with music. Didn't work. During it I just thought about the other stuff about me I don't like. Personality, ""achievements"", my hair and the ""hobbies"" I do in my free time.


I was done with my shower and then tried to appear relatively normal to my parents (still live with them cause I'm rather young). I went back to my room as stared at a switch blade I own. I thought about cutting myself. How hard, how much when or even if I should stop at all. I got scared of those thoughts so I put it under some furniture which would be difficult to move on my own. 


For the majority of the day I just kept to myself and thought about the sniveling dissapointment I am. About how my parents wouldn't love me as a person but are obligated to ""love"" me because I'm their son. About how bad I am at making or keeping friends. What a total waste of space and resources I am and how much pain I will still experience Vs how much joy I will experience. 


At about that time I started to write with a friend. Or rather the friend. He's the only one I got left. The only one who will actually listen to me and take me seriously. The only one who didn't leave me behind as soon as I wasn't running after him anymore. 

He asked me how I was doing and I said that I'm doing bad but that I don't want to ruin the evening by spamming my problems at him and misusing him as some venting forum or an unofficial therapist. He told me to do whatever makes me feel better, to which I respond that I don't have a clue what would make me feel better. 

We start this whole shabang about professional help and me not getting it. To be perfectly honest, I am not really sure why I don't seek out help. I know therapists are there, my country's healthcare system would probably pair me up with one for free but I just.... don't. I guess my main problem is that I simply cannot open myself up to anyone, let alone a complete stranger like that. I desperately don't want anyone to ever find out I'm seeing a therapist in fear of treating me differently.

That always happens with even the slightest change. I even mention one little thing and suddenly people pretend like it defines me and it's like I have no personality besides that. With therapy I am in flight or fight Mode when the topic comes up. 


The reason I gave my friend however was that I don't trust them. I'm not even sure if I meant that genuinely. But I bassically argued that therapists can be absolute shit at their job, just like normal, physical doctors (I have seen that before). I argued that they only seem to know what they're doing and that there is no truth behind them. No realism, just the ingrained message of death always being bad and life always being good. 


To keep it short I argued about how incredibly pointless it is and that therapy would only prologue my suffering isntead of ending it like suicide would. And he argued against that, for a little bit. He called me out about not even trying. Not having a single therapy session and that if I feel like dying is the answer that I should do what feels right.


Shortly after that I got out the switchblade and wanted to cut myself. Barely even broke skin. I can't believe what kind of a weakling I am. I still have so many scars pretty much no one knows about. I don't know what to do now.

Killing myself seems like such an easy and fast fix. No more me = no more pain for me. I don't want to just back out like some narcissistic pretender who only ever does this for attention. I don't want to just start a fight that will never pay off. I don't fucking know anymore. I just want a fresh start as someone else entirely.",t2_8nf3ngoy,False,,0,False,I relapsed today,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,,,0,,False,t3_12or2pq,False,dark,0.76,,public,2,0,{},2a7b5518-8e45-11e5-a506-0ed10b342609,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,False,,False,modmsg,[],{},,True,,1681683240.0,text,,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;(TW: profanities and slurs)&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I have a friend who is in a lot of debt. He's 28 years old. He's been in the crypto for a long time and it seems like he took loans from the banks even though he does not have a job. And the worst part is he convinced her sister(45) and older brother(40) took some loans for crypto as well. In total they are like 50.000 dollars deep in this debt which is a huge amount in our country.

Lately he is saying that the money is almost gone and after this month there will be nothing left. He is too overweight so he cannot have a job at the moment and his siblings can't afford to pay the installments even though they are both working.

The family doesn't know about this and he claims that it will destroy them if they ever found out. The biggest portion of the debt is on him and not his family. He thinks they can pay their loans but for him there is no hope. The family is already in psychological pain and trouble because none of the members had the chance to start their own family and their father is a gambler that lost a house years ago. His mother has been sick for a while like some back problems, mental issues etc.

He says that he cannot bare to see his family disappear because of him. I am telling him that his death won't make things better but probably will make them even worse so he should just focus on getting a job and start rebuilding. The banks can't take his life. They have to wait until he can afford the installments and make a new plan. But I don't think he is any convinced. He is more concerned about the family's situation and mental health or even their death. Now he is talking about ending his life might be a better solution.

At this point I don't know what I should do. I want to help him and his family but the debt is too much that none of us can afford a single installment. I though about warning his family but he begs me not to do it. And frankly I don't want to be responsible for any harm to his family either. On the other hand if I don't do anything, they might blame me for not telling them and I can blame myself forever. I just need some advice. What can I do?

He&amp;#39;s 28 years old. He&amp;#39;s been in the crypto for a long time and it seems like he took loans from the banks even though he does not have a job. And the worst part is he convinced her sister(45) and older brother(40) took some loans for crypto as well. In total they are like 50.000 dollars deep in this debt which is a huge amount in our country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately he is saying that the money is almost gone and after this month there will be nothing left. He is too overweight so he cannot have a job at the moment and his siblings can&amp;#39;t afford to pay the installments even though they are both working.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The family doesn&amp;#39;t know about this and he claims that it will destroy them if they ever found out. The biggest portion of the debt is on him and not his family. He thinks they can pay their loans but for him there is no hope. The family is already in psychological pain and trouble because none of the members had the chance to start their own family and their father is a gambler that lost a house years ago. His mother has been sick for a while like some back problems, mental issues etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He says that he cannot bare to see his family disappear because of him. I am telling him that his death won&amp;#39;t make things better but probably will make them even worse so he should just focus on getting a job and start rebuilding. The banks can&amp;#39;t take his life. They have to wait until he can afford the installments and make a new plan. But I don&amp;#39;t think he is any convinced. He is more concerned about the family&amp;#39;s situation and mental health or even their death. Now he is talking about ending his life might be a better solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point I don&amp;#39;t know what I should do. I want to help him and his family but the debt is too much that none of us can afford a single installment. I though about warning his family but he begs me not to do it. And frankly I don&amp;#39;t want to be responsible for any harm to his family either. On the other hand if I don&amp;#39;t do anything, they might blame me for not telling them and I can blame myself forever. I just need some advice. What can I do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR : My friend lost a lot of loan money in crypto. Now he is talking suicidal. Loan is impossible to pay. He can&amp;#39;t have a job. His family is a mess and they might die if they found out. What should I do?&lt;/p&gt;

To make a very long story short, a lot of my erratic and irrationally behavior has been affecting my friendship with someone I deem extremely close. After much research and deliberation with myself, I decided she deserved to know my mental state, how it's been declining, and my suicidal thoughts. 

The talk was actually well received, all things considered. She was accepting, non-judgmental, and understanding. All things good, right? Except for something I 100% should have taken into account but I did not. She said if I did do anything, she would blame herself. Now as we know, most people do blame themselves when people close to them kills themselves. But this is different. 

Remember me mentioning my behavior affecting the friendship? During those incidents, even though none of it was ever her fault and I made SURE to clarify this, she still has a real tendency to blame herself. With that in mind, I should have known she'd do the same with this most extreme thing.

I say all this to say suicide has been a comforting, therapeutic idea of sorts. A simple solution to a life time of shit and pain.

I don’t know what it was exactly that broke me, I think it was just everything piled together.

I hate my job, I’m in debt, I’m fucking seriously depressed. Everyone hates men, even my wife talks about how much better the world would be without men. Whenever she brings that up I just want to fucking do it. Rid myself of this earth and maybe if their right the world will be even .0001% better.

My sex life with my wife is awful. It’s not even really her fault because she had a history that makes sex hard for her. But it sucks. I’ve been in misery for the past 4 years and no matter how often we talk about it, how often we try to work things out, it never gets better. 

I’m pretty sure my wife isn’t even into me anymore and I think she uses her past as an excuse as to why we don’t have sex. She talks about how much she loves transgender and nonbinary people all the time. She even once said that if I died she wouldn’t date another man. I’m inclined to grant her wish.

I’ve thought about leaving. I can’t. It would destroy her if I left her and I couldn’t live with that. She has enough to deal with already and me leaving would make it 10 times worse for her. Plus everyone loves her. My family, friends, everyone loves her and if I left I’d probably lose most of those people too.

I’ve thought about castrating myself. That would solve a lot of things. But the thought of losing that is… hard. Especially if she chooses to leave after. Ending it seems easier.

I had contemplated ending it in a hotel room a month ago. Couldn’t bring myself to do it. I thought of my sister and how hard it would be if she had to find out about that. But I don’t know. Maybe if I can stage an accident it can make things easier for everyone involved.

The odd part is I don&amp;#39;t reject these thoughts. I dwell on them for long periods of time and now I&amp;#39;m getting scared that I&amp;#39;ll actually do it, cause the more I think about it, the more it seems so easy to do.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"-I'm french sorry for my bad english
Aight so let me explain everything. First of all I'm a M(20) I have a chronic health problem since I was born its called sickle cell anemia and that shit made my life miserable, kinda hard to explain but I always suffered from hard pain's that make me just wanted to die since I was a kid, Sometimes the pain change but to explain for some pains it feels that's someone is torturing you endlessly I always end up at the hospital atleast 3-4 times a year sometimes its more sometimes it's less but it's always around these numbers but when I'm not at hospital I can manage the pain by staying home cuz I always suffer from my chronic problem atleast 2-3 times every 2 months or around and it really messed up my scholarship (I live in canada) so I always managed to barely pass every year but at the year 2020 everything got f**k*d up for covid they decided to cancel the 3rd trimester and I didn't pass anything in the second trimester cuz I was alway's sick (I'm always sick at winter) so it messed me up and I didn't managed to pass my 4th grade to get in my last grade and finish Highshool. (I couldn't redo my 4th grade again cuz I was on my way being 18) (I already double my 4th at primaire or elemental school I don't know how y'all say in english)

I tried my best I did go to adult school and all but lack of motivation and my (wanting to die, It was always like that but after that year it got worse) it just messed me up and dropped it and now I see nobody don't really have friends anymore and my future I know will be f**k*d

At 2022 I was like aight you know what Ima try my best my sickle cell anemia hitted again but it didn't caused me pain naah it did something worst it took something that all men at the age of 18-20 will want to use sometimes (if you didn't understand sorry I don't want to precise it here but I'm just gonna say that the big tower doesn't work anymore all I can do is pee and nothing else 😅)
And I think I don't need to say why it messed up my mood and self estim reaaaaaally good anyway

2023 my big tower still doesn't work my sickle anemia still won't calm down and the worst of all I managed to gain information more about my disease and somehow I learned that my life expentency are around 50 yrs old like bro the hell is that I was on my way trying my best to continue my study and now I learned that somehow even with all the money I will make I won't even be able to profite really from it 

Since march 2022 I always need to go back to the hospital every 6 weeks ( I hate going to the hospital) and now I heard that my disease can cause problems in the nervous system and that it can lowkey mess up my memories and my mobility in the future like bro at this point I'm tired

And plus I have difficulties working ( I worked only 2 jobs in my life for now ) both of them was kinda physic and guess what I didn't even last 1 week each without going to the hospital the first one I was fired cuz it lowkey messed them that I didn't show up for 2weeks wich I was at the hospital and the second I managed myself to work for 1 months even with all my pains I ended up at the hospital only 2 time but I had to do my best cuz my laptop was broken and I needed a new one so I managed to get the money I needed and then I stopped working cuz I had a huge pain in the chest just needed to work 2-3 days more the time they found someone else.

I won't lie I feel like I'm just trapped I can't even have some freedom or peace, with the fact that I need to go to the hospital every 6 weeks I feel like an old person who need assistance. With the fact that I live in canada (thats the only optimist thing) I don't need to pay for my healtcare with the insurance card but still every winter I suffer even tho i just really want to go outisde from here and explore the world (it was my maingoal when I was little grab a good diploma for something like accounting and finance then trying to go outside from here) but feel's like my chronic dissease destroyed that dream I can't go outisde from here cuz imagine myself in the united states I will end up with a good 1millions bills just from the hospitals. 

I think Ima end the text here cuz if not it gonna end up being a book I tried my best to say everything but not too long and not in much details

All I want is just some of y'all point of views 

For now I'm just focusing on trying to finish my Highshool then get in cegep to atleast have an diploma in accounting. I don't think I can afford university cuz I'm born in a poor family and that I can't really managed to work cuz of my dissease or atleast I can try something that's not too much physics cuz thats what can trigger the pain.
On the side quest I'm trying to learn about financials and everything that can make me being an entrepreneur that way I hope I will managed to minimum being at the age of 35 and being a minimum financial stable that way I can enjoy the 15 years left of my life in peace and without too much worries.

For some reason I feel like I didn't have any luck at all some people with my dissease don't have much problem but it looks like I'm on the side wich where we have a lot of problems naaah when ima die me and god will have a good talk to talk frrr he own me some answers pam 😂😂",t2_i3kfljqa,False,,0,False,I just wanna die to end from suffering,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,,,0,,False,t3_12oe6nh,False,dark,0.81,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1681659953.0,text,,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;-I&amp;#39;m french sorry for my bad english

,SuicideWatch,"This is going to be a long post. I don't even know how, or where to start. First of all, I am a 23 year old male, living in eastern Europe. I am afraid of dying as I do  not believe in an afterlife, but recently I am starting to become more and more afraid of continuing to live. I feel like I'm taking one step forward and two steps back every time I try to improve my life. Sometimes life even teases me, I manage to go 100 steps forward, but then twice as fast I'll go 300 steps back. I know what the root cause of this is, but I simply do not have the energy to fight anymore.

I am yet another case of a person broken by a narcissistic father. My father is the most selfish and manipulative person, and my mother is the exact opposite: I've never met anyone more wholesome, loving and caring than her. They both lived in dysfunctional families, yet they had the strength to persevere, especially my mom, but I simply can't.

The only thing my father did good during my childhood was providing enough financial support from us. As for the rest, she left me in the sole care of my mom. She never was a stay at home mom, she worked a full time job and took care of me at the same time. My dad would do a bit of overtime, but not as much as he said, as he admitted recently that whenever he heard me crying he would just turn around and go have a beer with his work mates, and come home to sleep. My mother did the best she could, but I am an only child and due to how our medical system was back then, with careless doctors and such, I wasn't given supplements at birth and developed rickets because of it. My father blames this on my mother continuously, whenever he wouldn't even take me outside for some fresh air.

He went to work abroad for a few years (3-4 years if I remember correctly), then he came back right when I started school. Since then, he began verbally abusing my mother whenever he had a fight with his mother (my grandma), and started drinking more and more to the point of these fights would be a weekly occurrence. Even though they weren't daily, I would always be afraid of when will the next one be. He even wanted to physically beat my mom once, but I jumped in, even though I was a child, and punched him as hard as I could. 

Even though I had those issues at home, I was a very social kid, up until 6th grade, but I would be bullied a lot. The bullying started from the 2nd grade, and continued up until 6th grade. I tried to tell my parents, but my dad would give me generic answers just to get rid of me, like ""just ignore them, eventually they will lose interest"". My mom would come sometimes to school, she would talk to my teacher and the bullies would stop for a week at best, but my mom couldn't take time off work all day everyday and my school was corrupt. My teacher was a mentally damaged lady in her mid 40s who lost her son, and yet talked about him as he was still alive. They didn't kick her out because she worked there for many years and knew everyone, and the school's management team was more useless than her. My first thoughts about unaliving myself appeared during this time, cause for at least 4 years my life was the following: Wake up, go to school, get physically bullied before classes start, get bullied during classes (being blamed for talking or being rude, teachers would believe the bullies), go home fast before bullies can catch me and beat me up again, have 2 hours to myself where I would cry, then my parents would come home and I'd be on edge until I went to sleep.

After 6th grade, my dad started to behave more nicely. Why? His dad (my grandpa), who was the exact opposite of my dad (loving, caring, funny, a pleasure to be around), had an accident and he'd be in and out of the hospital. When he was out of the hospital, he was spending half the time at our place and we'd take care of him, since his wife was even worse than my dad. We kept this going until he died 3 years later, when I was in 9th grade. The bullying completely has stopped by then, because I started to fight, and I had so much rage bottled in that I actually began to like fighting bullies, especially after getting punched first.

After 9th grade, I've only had one bully, which I couldn't fight since he's a rich, strong boy, but I didn't shut up whenever he threatened me either. I did not care what happened to me then.

I was 15 years old when I joined 9th grade, and this was back in 2015. From 2016 on, small fights started to happen more and more frequently, until in 2017 whenever I thought my family was going in the right direction, my father, after another argument with my grandma, started insulting my mother and drinking heavily, and I broke down. I went to him and told him that I hate him and I hate being alive, and I rushed to get my shoes and go to attempt my first serious suicide attempt, but my mom physically restrained me and took all my shoes away from me, and locked me and her both in my room, away from my dad and for her to keep an eye on me. I smoked 2 packs of cigarettes that night alone.

After that event, I told her straight in the face: ""mom, I can't do this any longer. I feel like my head is exploding, I can't stay here anymore"". My mother proceeded to talk with some relatives and moved in with them, without my father's knowing, for 3 months. Eventually I moved in back when my mother pleaded me, as she wanted us to be a family again. I accepted after days of insisting, only because I didn't want to be a burden to my relatives.

Well, after that, the fights stopped entirely. No more fights, no more toxicity, I graduated highschool, I found a remote work from home job and started college. I loved my life. I was going to college, work, going to the gym and game whenever I had time. Then the pandemic hit. I lost my job due to the company going bankrupt, I was stressed daily due to college stuff, as teachers were putting homework randomly and chaotically, and life was falling apart. My grandma from my mother's side also got sick, and I loved her very much. I couldn't handle it. I told my mother I wanted to go to therapy, she agreed. I told my father, he said he couldn't see why I'd want therapy since I do not have any problems and I am a happy child. I told him that this was not the case, and told him to remember everything he'd done and how I almost killed myself. HE DENIED EVERYTHING and said ""I only did what I thought was best for this family"" with tears in his eyes. He finally accepted to support me. I needed their help, since I didn't know if my saves were enough to cover all of the costs.

I've been on treatment for 2 years, graduated college, passed all of my exams first try, but after I graduated college, my father became really pushy. Not even one week after I finished, he rushed in my room telling me about this HUGE job opportunity someone told him about, and how it is a sign. I didn't want to start work just now, since I was mentally and physically exhausted after having 3 months of working daily almost non stop so I could finish my last year of college. He pushed me for AN ENTIRE WEEK and I gave up and accepted. After that, he thought it would be the best for me to also have a master's degree, and same thing, pressure after pressure daily and I caved in. He also tried to push a few more things, but enough was enough and even he realized it. If it was up to him I'd be working full time in a demanding job, study for my master's, study for my driver's license, and take a Python course online.

I felt so burnt out as the free days I had this summer I spent being stressed about the upcoming exam I had to take for that job. I didn't take that job, but at least I managed to stop my SSRI treatment during that time and master's was going well. But guess what, my father had the AUDACITY to tell people that ""WE graduated college"" and ""WE are doing really well in master"", basically it wasn't my achievement, it was OURS. My morale dropped, especially after I told him to stop and he wouldn't.

What I listed in this long story is just the surface of the iceberg. He liked to micromanage everything I did. He was pressuring me to go with him to shops and buy me clothes, and he never told me ""I found this shirt I think you'd love it"", no, it was always ""I always wanted this and that as a child, and if I couldn't have it, I want you to have it"". He was, and still is, living through me. He does not see me as a person, he started seeing me as an extension of himself. I am starting to feel less and less like a person. I am feeling like I am trapped, like I cannot escape him.

I wanted to go work and be independent after college, but I am now jobless, with no energy and unable to focus on anything, struggling to pass my master's classes, I have very few friends who never invite me anywhere and are always busy when I invite them so I am spending 99% of my time at home. My only goal now is to wait for summer, to go to some music festivals and see my favorite artists. This, and the fact that my mom is alive, are the only things that keep me going somehow, but I don't know for how long.

I am 23 years old, yet I am feeling like I already lost the best part of my life, and I'm really behind. I lack many skills, and many told me that it is my responsability to fix my life, and that I should be more forgiving. I do not completely disagree with the first statement, but it is just like taking a 3 year old indoor cat, putting it in the middle of nowhere in the woods, and expect it to survive and hunt like the other felines, as it is it's responsability to survive.

I am also a hypochondriac as of recently, been having random pains (intercostal, heart and on the sides of the abdomen) and I think I'm suffering from something serious that it is in its early stages, even though the doctors are telling me everything's fine.

I am living in a constant state of fear: fear of dying, fear of diseases, fear of living, fear of the future, fear of disappointing my mother

I feel like something in me is shutting down. I feel like I want to cry, yet I can't. I just want to escape this hell, yet I see no escape that allows me to be alive and happy.

If this is going to be my last post, I want to say sorry to my mom, to my few friends who listened to me, and to the fellow redditors who sacrificed their time to read my posts and give me advice, or just a ""hey, i'm here and i've heard your story, you're not alone"", seriously thank you.

My first thoughts about unaliving myself appeared during this time, cause for at least 4 years my life was the following: Wake up, go to school, get physically bullied before classes start, get bullied during classes (being blamed for talking or being rude, teachers would believe the bullies), go home fast before bullies can catch me and beat me up again, have 2 hours to myself where I would cry, then my parents would come home and I&amp;#39;d be on edge until I went to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 6th grade, my dad started to behave more nicely. Why? His dad (my grandpa), who was the exact opposite of my dad (loving, caring, funny, a pleasure to be around), had an accident and he&amp;#39;d be in and out of the hospital. When he was out of the hospital, he was spending half the time at our place and we&amp;#39;d take care of him, since his wife was even worse than my dad. We kept this going until he died 3 years later, when I was in 9th grade. The bullying completely has stopped by then, because I started to fight, and I had so much rage bottled in that I actually began to like fighting bullies, especially after getting punched first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 9th grade, I&amp;#39;ve only had one bully, which I couldn&amp;#39;t fight since he&amp;#39;s a rich, strong boy, but I didn&amp;#39;t shut up whenever he threatened me either. I did not care what happened to me then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was 15 years old when I joined 9th grade, and this was back in 2015. From 2016 on, small fights started to happen more and more frequently, until in 2017 whenever I thought my family was going in the right direction, my father, after another argument with my grandma, started insulting my mother and drinking heavily, and I broke down. I went to him and told him that I hate him and I hate being alive, and I rushed to get my shoes and go to attempt my first serious suicide attempt, but my mom physically restrained me and took all my shoes away from me, and locked me and her both in my room, away from my dad and for her to keep an eye on me. I smoked 2 packs of cigarettes that night alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that event, I told her straight in the face: &amp;quot;mom, I can&amp;#39;t do this any longer. I feel like my head is exploding, I can&amp;#39;t stay here anymore&amp;quot;. My mother proceeded to talk with some relatives and moved in with them, without my father&amp;#39;s knowing, for 3 months. Eventually I moved in back when my mother pleaded me, as she wanted us to be a family again. I accepted after days of insisting, only because I didn&amp;#39;t want to be a burden to my relatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, after that, the fights stopped entirely. No more fights, no more toxicity, I graduated highschool, I found a remote work from home job and started college. I loved my life. I was going to college, work, going to the gym and game whenever I had time. Then the pandemic hit. I lost my job due to the company going bankrupt, I was stressed daily due to college stuff, as teachers were putting homework randomly and chaotically, and life was falling apart. My grandma from my mother&amp;#39;s side also got sick, and I loved her very much. I couldn&amp;#39;t handle it. I told my mother I wanted to go to therapy, she agreed. I told my father, he said he couldn&amp;#39;t see why I&amp;#39;d want therapy since I do not have any problems and I am a happy child. I told him that this was not the case, and told him to remember everything he&amp;#39;d done and how I almost killed myself. HE DENIED EVERYTHING and said &amp;quot;I only did what I thought was best for this family&amp;quot; with tears in his eyes. He finally accepted to support me. I needed their help, since I didn&amp;#39;t know if my saves were enough to cover all of the costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been on treatment for 2 years, graduated college, passed all of my exams first try, but after I graduated college, my father became really pushy. Not even one week after I finished, he rushed in my room telling me about this HUGE job opportunity someone told him about, and how it is a sign. I didn&amp;#39;t want to start work just now, since I was mentally and physically exhausted after having 3 months of working daily almost non stop so I could finish my last year of college. He pushed me for AN ENTIRE WEEK and I gave up and accepted. After that, he thought it would be the best for me to also have a master&amp;#39;s degree, and same thing, pressure after pressure daily and I caved in. He also tried to push a few more things, but enough was enough and even he realized it. If it was up to him I&amp;#39;d be working full time in a demanding job, study for my master&amp;#39;s, study for my driver&amp;#39;s license, and take a Python course online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt so burnt out as the free days I had this summer I spent being stressed about the upcoming exam I had to take for that job. I didn&amp;#39;t take that job, but at least I managed to stop my SSRI treatment during that time and master&amp;#39;s was going well. But guess what, my father had the AUDACITY to tell people that &amp;quot;WE graduated college&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;WE are doing really well in master&amp;quot;, basically it wasn&amp;#39;t my achievement, it was OURS. My morale dropped, especially after I told him to stop and he wouldn&amp;#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I listed in this long story is just the surface of the iceberg. He liked to micromanage everything I did. He was pressuring me to go with him to shops and buy me clothes, and he never told me &amp;quot;I found this shirt I think you&amp;#39;d love it&amp;quot;, no, it was always &amp;quot;I always wanted this and that as a child, and if I couldn&amp;#39;t have it, I want you to have it&amp;quot;. He was, and still is, living through me. He does not see me as a person, he started seeing me as an extension of himself. I am starting to feel less and less like a person. I am feeling like I am trapped, like I cannot escape him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to go work and be independent after college, but I am now jobless, with no energy and unable to focus on anything, struggling to pass my master&amp;#39;s classes, I have very few friends who never invite me anywhere and are always busy when I invite them so I am spending 99% of my time at home. My only goal now is to wait for summer, to go to some music festivals and see my favorite artists. This, and the fact that my mom is alive, are the only things that keep me going somehow, but I don&amp;#39;t know for how long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am 23 years old, yet I am feeling like I already lost the best part of my life, and I&amp;#39;m really behind. I lack many skills, and many told me that it is my responsability to fix my life, and that I should be more forgiving. I do not completely disagree with the first statement, but it is just like taking a 3 year old indoor cat, putting it in the middle of nowhere in the woods, and expect it to survive and hunt like the other felines, as it is it&amp;#39;s responsability to survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also a hypochondriac as of recently, been having random pains (intercostal, heart and on the sides of the abdomen) and I think I&amp;#39;m suffering from something serious that it is in its early stages, even though the doctors are telling me everything&amp;#39;s fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am living in a constant state of fear: fear of dying, fear of diseases, fear of living, fear of the future, fear of disappointing my mother&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like something in me is shutting down. I feel like I want to cry, yet I can&amp;#39;t. I just want to escape this hell, yet I see no escape that allows me to be alive and happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is going to be my last post, I want to say sorry to my mom, to my few friends who listened to me, and to the fellow redditors who sacrificed their time to read my posts and give me advice, or just a &amp;quot;hey, i&amp;#39;m here and i&amp;#39;ve heard your story, you&amp;#39;re not alone&amp;quot;, seriously thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a very long post, and I am sorry for that but I also realized I needed to vent somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Yeah.

So, basically, I used to follow whatever my parents told me and I used to be almost right-wing because of it. I changed around 8th and 9th grade because I was finally able to think for myself, but that doesn't change the fact that I've essentially tarnished my worth in this world.

I'm still a horrible person, though. Not just because I've been branded with that label since my first moral mistake, but also because I'm a massive bully, liar, and abuser.

I'm almost inclined to call myself a sociopath or psychopath at this point, but my therapists would probably deny it just to spare my feelings. It wouldn't hurt me at this point, though, because I've accepting any sort of terrible label that could possibly apply to me.

As for what makes me a liar, bully, and abuser... I lie all the time just to save my revolting ass. I've never once been merciful on my parents—always oppositional, discipline-resistant, and hurtful with my words. I've always been a spoiled, raging nightmare.

I used to (and still do) try to bully and intimidate my peers because I got joy from feeling powerful and watching them suffer.

I met this guy in 10th grade (also autistic, like me *apparently*). I will admit I was curious about him and may have had a crush on him—though one time he asked me out in the middle of the hallway and I didn't have much time to think, so I said yes without thinking. I hated myself for the rest of the day. I don't want to consider it dating, but maybe it was. I refused any sort of affection other than a simple hug (everyone hugs, right?). When he tried being romantic with me, I shot it down immediately. I eventually (for whatever reason) decided I was absolutely revolted by him and started avoiding him like the plague. I still hate him simply because he liked me. I yelled at him once or twice for walking to close to me, and I curse his name for telling everyone around me that we were dating (I never wanted to call it that).

Now I don't know what to do. I've been nothing but shitty all my life, and it feels impossible to change. For some reason, I get some sort of sadistic pleasure from ""getting back at"" my victims. I can't escape this—if only I could forget my entire life and start anew.",t2_ved9yhtz,False,,0,False,I'm a horrible person.,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,,,0,,False,t3_12opdy4,False,dark,0.99,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1681679958.0,text,,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, basically, I used to follow whatever my parents told me and I used to be almost right-wing because of it. I changed around 8th and 9th grade because I was finally able to think for myself, but that doesn&amp;#39;t change the fact that I&amp;#39;ve essentially tarnished my worth in this world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still a horrible person, though. Not just because I&amp;#39;ve been branded with that label since my first moral mistake, but also because I&amp;#39;m a massive bully, liar, and abuser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m almost inclined to call myself a sociopath or psychopath at this point, but my therapists would probably deny it just to spare my feelings. It wouldn&amp;#39;t hurt me at this point, though, because I&amp;#39;ve accepting any sort of terrible label that could possibly apply to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for what makes me a liar, bully, and abuser... I lie all the time just to save my revolting ass. I&amp;#39;ve never once been merciful on my parents—always oppositional, discipline-resistant, and hurtful with my words. I&amp;#39;ve always been a spoiled, raging nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to (and still do) try to bully and intimidate my peers because I got joy from feeling powerful and watching them suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I met this guy in 10th grade (also autistic, like me &lt;em&gt;apparently&lt;/em&gt;). I will admit I was curious about him and may have had a crush on him—though one time he asked me out in the middle of the hallway and I didn&amp;#39;t have much time to think, so I said yes without thinking. I hated myself for the rest of the day. I don&amp;#39;t want to consider it dating, but maybe it was. I refused any sort of affection other than a simple hug (everyone hugs, right?). When he tried being romantic with me, I shot it down immediately. I eventually (for whatever reason) decided I was absolutely revolted by him and started avoiding him like the plague. I still hate him simply because he liked me. I yelled at him once or twice for walking to close to me, and I curse his name for telling everyone around me that we were dating (I never wanted to call it that).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. I&amp;#39;ve been nothing but shitty all my life, and it feels impossible to change. For some reason, I get some sort of sadistic pleasure from &amp;quot;getting back at&amp;quot; my victims. I can&amp;#39;t escape this—if only I could forget my entire life and start anew.&lt;/p&gt;

either way, i think it worked. my moms husband beat me and my mother proceeded to kick me out. told the whole family, as they revel in the drama. which is ironic because no one reaches out, even before that. even when i purposefully made myself available, desperate for any human interaction i can find.

 recently, i dropped everything in my savings to fix up a camper to live in and my biological father repeatedly broke in and began sleeping, shooting up meth, and doing generally bad shit. i told him he couldnt stay if he kept breaking the rules of the park as it would jeopardize everything. he didnt care and when threatened by the park due to his actions. i simply starting walking.

 guess someone called a close friend and told them because she came and found me and now i work for the company. 

whats crazy is ive spent my entire life riding this moral high horse that ive never done drugs except weed due to my fathers own use but here i am, in the same position. funny actually.

Every time I make mistakes, I think of death. Mistakes always ruin everything.

Every time I have to do something I don’t want, I think of death. 

Every day, I wake up and wish that I’ll get hit by a truck and when I arrive home I think of hanging myself.

Now, I’m thinking of harming myself-again. Because I feel tired for the week and the next.

,SuicideWatch,"I don't want to go back to school. There's only so much I can do to delude myself and convince myself that I won't go back. If it comes to it my mom will drag me in. I'm behind in everything. Failing, you guessed it, everything. I can barley function most days. I've managed to push myself a bit, and now instead of just sleeping all day and crying, I talk to my best friend as well. It's the highlight of my day if I'm honest.

I don't particularly want to leave my friend. But everything else is too much. The stress gives me multiple migranes, and it hurts so bad. I don't want to go back to school. I physically can't. I don't want to go outside or leave my room. I was finally starting to get better. I can't take anymore unnecessary stress. I've been trying to tackle my self harm addiction. Problem is, with school I find myself pulling staples out of the walls and retreating to the bathrooms to hurt myself and attempt to end my life by slitting my wrists. I can't do it.

My final exams are coming up in a month. I can't do it. I'm suffering from an eating disorder, which makes this whole thing worse. My friend makes me want to live. But everything else that I can't control makes me want to die more than anything I've ever felt. I can't deal with my family. With school. With the upcoming exams and my future. I just can't. 

I wish I could decide how my life went, and then I could probably try to live. But all I can think about right now is death. I've got two days until I go back to school. If nothing happens during those two days that prevents me from going back to school, I'm going to take another overdose. I'll take more this time. I wish I was strong enough to hold on. I mean it's stupid that the threat of a tiny but of added stress pushes me this far over the edge. 

I want to stay alive this time I think. But I also don't. I want to stay in my room, safe, talking to my friend and playing video games. It helps so much, just existing with no responsibilities, no need to fix everything, minimal stress. Until that moment is over. I'm holding on for a single moment every day. I wish every day could be like the time I spend with my friend. I forget time is actually passing, and I finally feel stuff again, which isn't pain or fear. 

But everything else is too much. I'm constantly overstimulated from autism my mom thinks she can sort of 'train me out of' if I just 'push myself' and try harder. I've got no motivation to do my school work. I've given up. I gave up on my school work and any aspect of a future for myself months ago. And now everything is getting worse. If I even think about it for a second, I break down. 

My depression is worsening. I've had it since I was eight, maybe even before that. And now I'm writing the letters again, like I've done so many times before. I'm planning what to do. And in two days I'll try again. Hopefully third times the charm, eh? I just don't know. At the very least, if I do survive, I hope I don't have to go home from the hospital afterwards because my mom can't be mean to me when we're in the hospital.

 She can yell and scream at me about how selfish and horrible I am, tell me how much of a Coward I am, but she will also have to calm down if nurses or doctors come near. I don't know. I want to die. I still want to. But I'm torn. I don't want to leave my friend. I promised them I'd be their friend forever. It'd be rude of me to leave them. I'm just so overwhelmed right now. It hurts.

I was getting back on track. I truly thought I was going to get better. But I'm foolish. I've spent almost every day lying in bed napping and crying all day. Cutting myself all night, and spending 2-4 hours a day playing video games with my friend who doesn't even know how big of a help they've been. They don't know about all this shit. And now it's all stacked up too high where I've been ignoring and avoiding it and it's about to come crashing down. 

I can't tell my mom. She'd go mental. Yell at me. Call me a Selfish Coward and keep me under 24 hour watch, which would make me want to kill myself more.  She'd probably also ban me from my phone and other stuff, so I'd have to lose my only support system (venting on reddit lol) and my ability to contact my friend, leaving me all alone again. I never realised how much the loneliness contributed to my pain until I made a friend. 

I don't know what to do. I'm in one of those moods. The ones where I make a decision that changes everything. The last time I felt like this I attempted suicide. The time before that I also attempted. And the time before that I got kicked out of school. I'm about to do something big, most likely another attempt. And I'm afraid. I just really wanted to tell someone, yknow? Get it off my chest.

I am not imminently suicidal. I got rid of my guns a few months ago anyway, I live in a trailer so jumping ain't an option unless I just want to break a leg, and if I tried it with pills I would get high, feel better, and regret my coming death. What a buzzkill.

As a member of this social species, I am driven to share these thoughts. I don't talk to anyone on these matters. This is the first time sharing any of this. I just can't take holding it alone anymore. Whoever, if anyone, reads this signed up for it of their own will. You get what you get. I'm still sorry though. I typed the following yesterday evening. It's nonsensical, offensive and full of grammatical errors, but I wasn't going for a master's thesis. I don't mean every nasty thing in it all the time, or to a high degree of certainty. I'm just not all that stable, and writing it out made me feel better. Here ya' go.

 The first time I put a gun to my head, I was 9. I was alone in a shooting house with my dad somewhere else in the hunting club. I don't know why I did it. I was just sad. I've never stopped being sad. The happy moments since then have been fleeting. No lingering joy, no lasting good mood. The second the laughter dies down and smiles go flat, right back to sadness. I don't want a life if I'm gonna feel this way. And with that, I'm selfish. Look! another way I'm a bad fucking person. I'm a bad person. I'm bad at being a person. I don't even feel like a person. I'm some lower thing relegated to serve the whims of the actual people, and I can't even do that right. I could be a person if I grew a spine, if I gripped reality, if I just stepped the fuck up to be a patient, loving father, parter, son, brother and friend. I can't seem to do it though. This mind won't stop it's screaming for one goddamn second. ""You're filth"" it says. ""You're hopeless, you're stupid, you're unattractive, you're unimaginative, you're a fucking coward"". Not to forget ""you're crazy"" as proved by this bullshit little note. I'm gonna do it one day. I've thought for a long time I'd cash out around middle age, but it seems like it might be coming sooner. If I can't get real, meaningful help, I won't last long. I tried, sorta. I had an appointment with some overpriced rent-a-fake-friend to listen to my unhinged tantrum for an hour, but it came around and I couldn't pay. Go figure. The fucking libral faggots I listen to, and who convinced me it wasn't cowardly to seek help, are supposed to be ""there for the little guy"", but when it comes to those power coupons, you'd better have plenty to fork over. At least the fascists on the other side will be honest about how little they care. The truth is, no one should have to care. No one is obligated to give the first fuck about me, or my needing help. ""You're not alone"". Suck my fucking 40th percentile, crooked dick, mother fucker. I'm so goddamn angry I can't see straight!  Anger, that's my most relished emotion. I wrote a line in some head cannon for a character, ""There is no better feeling, better than sex, better than any drug, than the rush I get when looking into the eyes of someone who's scared of me"". I wonder how much of that is really me. Would I be a tyrant if I had the ability? Am I a psychopath? I definitely have the dark triad traits to some degree. Is that my true self? If so, then suicide would be my best option for the world at large, as small as it's effect may be. I read articles on mental health. They talk about negative traits in people, but always to someone suffering due to those traits in others, and more power to them. I know I'm a fucking terror. What then should I, and those like me, do? Die? Where's my article? Did anyone ever think that we ""dark triad villans"" may suffer from our own minds? Does it even matter if we do? Am I just born irredeemable? Fuck. I'm so tired of existence. Not a fan. Not for me. I don't wish to take it away from others. I want there to be a beautiful, happy world full of beautiful, happy idiots, with happy go feely bullshit raining from the fucking sky, but the world I belong to has no such leisure. My world is dark and ugly, and the sky rains nuclear armageddon. I guess I should grow the fuck up, smell the bullshit and learn to like it.

as i said in the title, im 19 y/o and afab, and would guess my weight is somewhere around 130-150lbs. i am prescribed 50mg prozac regularly (40mg+10mg pills every day). 300mg is 6 times that dose (i took 6 of each pill). I have not taken any other drugs or medications recently.

Looking for straightforward information on what i should expect. Most importantly: how long will it take for any symptoms to set in? Is it safe to sleep or should i try to stay awake?

I want to avoid going to the ER at all costs, unless i am somehow absolutely going to die if i don't (which i very much doubt).

My mum is in the room next-door as I type this and I'm debating on killing myself before I get too attached to people.
I don't wanna live but I don't wanna feel this pain anymore, it's tiring and I'm overwhelmed with my future - I'm starting college soon but I don't even know what I want to do, I have no motivation to do anything (clean, eat , basic hygiene, ect)
I'm failing in school and I know it, my teachers are trying their best but so am I, it's just not working.
My mum tells me that I have to try harder and revise more but I mentally exhaust myself when I do.
Then when my family go out I have to clean but instead sit on my phone, scrolling for hours until they finally get home, yelled at and then go slit my wrists some more.
I can't tell the truth to my own mother as I'm afraid of the person who sa'd me as he told me off when I told the truth, I hate who I am and don't ever feel worthy.
I want to end my worthless, empty life but I'm too scared of surviving and being called an attention seeker.
My mum came home yesterday after going out saying how I was a disappointment.
I recently found a friend though.. just like me, but I don't want to hurt him, he's my best friend and he means alot to me and tell him not to kill himself.
I just don't want to hurt him, or anyone else like family, friends, ect but I just can't stand living in pain anymore.
I don't have a set date maybe after May (maybe March) I just wish that I was enough.

The world has gotten worse, my capacity to deal with situations has gotten worse, life with all its debt, rent, bills, mortgages, and every other cost under the sun has gotten worse. 
I don't want to participate in this world any more. I don't think my mind is going to change. It hasn't for years. 

I feel like no matter what I do, I'm harming someone. I express my feelings, it brings others down. I go to the doctor, I inconvenience them and then they forget about me after 2 weeks. Even the food I manage to buy is made with extreme harm to the environment, purely by how it's packaged. I can't spend money on things I want because that's wasting money, which makes me feel worse. 

I feel like I'm a black hole of misery. I drag people in and make them miserable too. I'm tired of being miserable. I'm tired of being tired. I'm tired of hurting everyone around me just by being like this. I'm tired.

Medication, after medication, after medication, after medication. Nothing. Therapy? Nothing. I've been to 5 different therapists in the past ten years and 4 different psychiatrists. Will it ever end?

It's debilitating at this point. If it weren't for my parents I wouldn't be here. I can't imagine them finding me, having to go through that after all that they've done for me. I love them too much, so I'm here for them. This is something I've only realized in the past few years. How much love and support my parents have to offer. If it weren't for them I'd be dead already. I attempted once as a teenager and have come close to attempting at least 10 times. Every. Single. Time. Without Fail. The one thing that stops me is the thought of my parents going through that. When they're gone one day, I think it will be time. I won't have much else to live for. I won't feel guilt. I won't hesitate.

I can barely even do work because of how debilitating everything is, how could I even pay off a loan? It's just my stomach. My stomach has led me down this wretched path. My arms? Flabbly, but I can deal with it. My legs? They touch, but its fine. My face? Not awful, a little chubby but it looks good on occasion. My stomach? Awful. Actually repulsive. I'm at the point where I'm thinking it might be worth it in an attempt to be happy. I'm sick of people telling me to work out and change my diet and everything will be fine. I've tried.

I used to bike for hours everyday I would bike from philly to cape may nj and back 100 miles there and back and I wouldn’t even realize I had a heart. Now I can’t walk 15mins. been trying to get help but it’s so hard. When I was younger maybe 11 mt mother maced me in the eyes and mouth and said if I didn’t go to therapt with her she’d put me She’d put me in a foster home. When I finally did she randomly took me out and did the whole thing over again to again jsut take me out during the first session. I didn’t even want to anyways so ig it was a blessing in disguise but I never knew why she did till my brother who’s also schizophrenic eventually told me she’d told the people abt her delusions of reptilians in the moon and they didn’t believe her so she took me out.&lt;/p&gt;

I have her contact details and information, she's normally really loving sweet and caring however she has times were she becomes self destructive and tries to block me from everything and kicks me out her life due to thinking my life is better off without her.

However she has never made suicide threats to me before until last night where she says she wants to kill herself on her birthday which is in 3 days, I've conveyed my feelings the night before and tried to reassure her and tried to be honest and understanding, I've just had a conversation with her over texting direct phone number. She wants to end everything with me and wants to cut me off, I had threatened to call authorities due to fear, yet I am unable to due to not knowing the procedure and having tried and no prevail. I'm not sure what to do now.

Welp, I don't think I can give it more than a week. My original plan was to try to give myself six months to fill up a bucket list, but at this point even that feels like too much and all I've done in the past few days was search up data on how to unalive myself or try talking to people I'm not too close to about my plans. I'm reaching out and trying to have an outlet, I guess?

I still have a bucket list for this week that's more doable giving that I'm pretty much broke and I can't go out much or travel. The idea of getting a job isn't even a question at this point and all I wanna do is sleep and listen to music until Friday. I gave up on taking my pills and I don't think I wanna give therapy or hospitalization another chance either. I'm kinda lost, I guess? I'm searching for some sorta argument to convince me to stay longer, but I will admit that I have some issues with tunnel vision and I'm just tired. I have a lot of conflicting thoughts atm.

I'm overall just tired and desperately trying to feel better in the time I have left, but all I end up doing is dig a bigger hole and I feel so empty.

I'm in that phase where I just grieve myself, I guess?

It feels cruel to me to not let someone who is this exhausted and done go, but I get not fully understanding why I see this as a viable and logical plan, I guess.

,SuicideWatch,"Nearing the end, not sure what can be done about this. Believe I have protracted withdrawal syndrome, that or something much worse is coming it. Have been experiencing all the symptoms of dysautonomia and got blood testing and MRIs done but they turned up nothing, but read this is a possibility of the CNS becoming hypersensitive due to Zoloft withdrawal. The pain has become unbearable, overwhelming fatigue and brain fog with the overwhelming need to move (akathisia). 

Don't want to use any medications as CNS is already sensitive enough as it is but use propranolol if things are especially bad in the moment, but it seems like it also has an affect on CNS because it crosses the blood-brain barrier. It is helpful in that it reduces adrenaline rushes and the need to move but it does cause more brain fog in return.

Have read that this goes on for months before improving so holding out the best I can now. Trying to not do anything that will make body worse and reduce stress as much as possible. When things are manageable, I can't believe I have these suicidal thoughts to begin with but in the thick of it it is very hard not to think about.

This is mostly my fault, for tapering too fast off of antidepressants and antipsychotics, desperately wanted to live a life without them but was unaware how bad fast tapering could be.

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t want to use any medications as CNS is already sensitive enough as it is but use propranolol if things are especially bad in the moment, but it seems like it also has an affect on CNS because it crosses the blood-brain barrier. It is helpful in that it reduces adrenaline rushes and the need to move but it does cause more brain fog in return. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have read that this goes on for months before improving so holding out the best I can now. Trying to not do anything that will make body worse and reduce stress as much as possible. When things are manageable, I can&amp;#39;t believe I have these suicidal thoughts to begin with but in the thick of it it is very hard not to think about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is mostly my fault, for tapering too fast off of antidepressants and antipsychotics, desperately wanted to live a life without them but was unaware how bad fast tapering could be. The akathisia was very hard to manage to begin with but with this worsening brain fog and fatigue don&amp;#39;t think I will be here for much longer. Would like to say that this is not because of depression, have had more passion to do things than I have in a long time, I deal with some anxiety and the fatigue is workable but the physical pain is too much.&lt;/p&gt;

I haven't been on here for the last 2 years. Now look  at me. ""It gets better"" is a bittersweet lie that punches you right in the gut when you start believing in. Here i am. 3 am.

Now i am  taking her down this path too.

She desperately wants me to be happy. Even if I fake it long enough, my sadness is still coming through and she blames herself for it, when I am to blame. She is the light of my life but i feel blind still. I wanted to be better. So so hard.

I hurt myself again. Yesterday. I was in a dark place and after being clean for years, this feeling of ""relief"" is just so enticing again. If she knew... i can't do this to her. I met her the night after attempting for the first time and it felt like she saved me. Stupid fairytale. No one can be safed. It's just a sick trope the film industry created to make us feel like we can be saved by someone else and everything will be rainbows and butterflies.

I'm someone who acts all though and stuff. I won't say
"" oh I'm really sensitive inside "" cuz I'm violent , I act violent , I talk violently. I even look violent. It's even hard to hurt my feelings cuz I don't care.

But when someone is constantly talking shit about me, saying that if I wanted to kill myself she'd help me to do so, that my scars were ugly asf, that she knows someone in this class who should kill themselves, that I'm ugly, that my clothes were ugly. It is somewhat too much.

I fucking tried to take it in . Idk why but when I wanted to beat her up everyone told me to calm down, ignore her and stuff. Because of her I even lost friends ( I'm happy it happened tho), but I am the one who is too sensitive or whatever. I don't want to act smarter there, I want to cut her head off with my teeth.

,SuicideWatch,"My name is Adam. I am 21 years old. I lived in Indiana almost my whole life, but at the time of my almost suicide i was living on campus at University. Currently I'm deliberating between taking the pills or dumping them in the toilet. If I have decided to follow through with the suicide, I will most likely have done it by consuming numerous tablets of Wellbutrin 150 MG. 

If I was a smarter man I'd have dumped them by this point, but I am not so here we are. For the people that find the mess I'm sorry. 

Now for the reason, I suppose. I hate myself. That's the main gist of it. I understand that I'm just causing more pain and trauma, but perhaps this was the better alternative than continuing to live. I'm not a competent human being. I'm lazy, I'm unattractive, and I'm toxic. 

I grew up in a fairly nice home, except my parents would put these expectations on me to be a perfect Christian. They say they don't expect perfection but they sure act like they do. I had good friends, but I treat them like shit. 
I wallow in misery and expect them to carry me. It's wrong of me to do so. To my friends and family, I'm sorry for my actions. I have hurt you, judged you, and mistreated you. I understand that my death will cause pain, but the pain will be temporary. You will move on. If I stay, the pain I inflict will never end. 

Now who is to blame for my misery? Myself. While events in life have exacerbated my pain, this is no one else's fault but my own. I did this to myself. 

I understand that this is sounds like self pity, because it is. But this is also to explain that the pain I inflict on myself is myself. Do not blame my friends or family.

I am still deliberating, but if I'm being honest, this will more than likely just go down as another attempt. Not in a ""I puked up the pills and I'm fine"" kind of attempt, but more like just deciding not to follow through and just throw the pills away. 

I deserve all the misery I get. I deserve every ounce pain in my heart. I will never amount to anything. So to punish myself, I will keep living, because I don't deserve love. Or happiness. I deserve hatred. I deserve to be alone.",t2_utmkgg68,False,,0,False,My almost suicide note,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,,,0,,False,t3_12nxb8a,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1681624216.0,text,,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My name is Adam. I am 21 years old. I lived in Indiana almost my whole life, but at the time of my almost suicide i was living on campus at University. Currently I&amp;#39;m deliberating between taking the pills or dumping them in the toilet. If I have decided to follow through with the suicide, I will most likely have done it by consuming numerous tablets of Wellbutrin 150 MG. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I was a smarter man I&amp;#39;d have dumped them by this point, but I am not so here we are. For the people that find the mess I&amp;#39;m sorry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now for the reason, I suppose. I hate myself. That&amp;#39;s the main gist of it. I understand that I&amp;#39;m just causing more pain and trauma, but perhaps this was the better alternative than continuing to live. I&amp;#39;m not a competent human being. I&amp;#39;m lazy, I&amp;#39;m unattractive, and I&amp;#39;m toxic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a fairly nice home, except my parents would put these expectations on me to be a perfect Christian. They say they don&amp;#39;t expect perfection but they sure act like they do. I had good friends, but I treat them like shit. 
I wallow in misery and expect them to carry me. It&amp;#39;s wrong of me to do so. To my friends and family, I&amp;#39;m sorry for my actions. I have hurt you, judged you, and mistreated you. I understand that my death will cause pain, but the pain will be temporary. You will move on. If I stay, the pain I inflict will never end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now who is to blame for my misery? Myself. While events in life have exacerbated my pain, this is no one else&amp;#39;s fault but my own. I did this to myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understand that this is sounds like self pity, because it is. But this is also to explain that the pain I inflict on myself is myself. Do not blame my friends or family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still deliberating, but if I&amp;#39;m being honest, this will more than likely just go down as another attempt. Not in a &amp;quot;I puked up the pills and I&amp;#39;m fine&amp;quot; kind of attempt, but more like just deciding not to follow through and just throw the pills away. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I deserve all the misery I get. I deserve every ounce pain in my heart. I will never amount to anything. So to punish myself, I will keep living, because I don&amp;#39;t deserve love. Or happiness. I deserve hatred. I deserve to be alone.&lt;/p&gt;

My wife left me last July. She left me alone to deal the stress of a new job, attempt to afford a brand new car and a brand new apartment and luckily for me, to take care of our dog.

She lost her mother and I can’t let her lose her father and be sent to a kennel or a family she is unfamiliar with.  So I’m coming to terms that she may have 5-6yrs left and I will be right by her side on this planet and beyond.

I have been isolated for a year now, with no friends, no girlfriend, and no life. Before 10th grade, life was great; I had a large group of friends with whom we would hang out, play games together, and just have fun. Maybe I wasn't so close to them, but at least I had someone to spend time with once a week besides my parents.

&amp;#x200B;

I was never really social in my life, because I got bullied throughout middle school, but in the 9th grade, I finally fit into a friend group. Unfortunately, in the 10th grade, I had to change schools because we moved to another city, and I started attending a specialized science high school. Now, I have absolutely no life. The school is really hard, and the main reason I am here is because of my parents. In order to pass my classes, I am forced to study for nearly five hours a day, almost every day. Throughout the year, I mostly studied at home and rarely went outside. This routine made me even more shy, and now, even though it's the holidays, I don't want to go outside. I look in the mirror and realize that I have no one to call or talk to; it's just me and my computer. I tried to make new friends at school and talk to people, but somehow, I didn't fit in. I even tried talking to the girls in my class, but they ended up calling me a weirdo and thinking I was hitting on them. The only ""friend"" I talk to in school isn't really my friend; he once snitched on me for cheating on an exam. I am at a point in my life where I don't really care about anything anymore, and I'm scared that this loneliness will never end.

,SuicideWatch,"I just need to get this off my chest. Even though this happened a little while ago now, it still bothers me to this day whenever I think about it.
I'm 18 now, so obviously I made it through that moment, but when I was barely 16, I had my worst suicide attempt. It was 3 days after my 16th birthday. I overdosed on a very large amount of pills. I was home alone when I did it but my dad came home and found me about 20 mins later, I was still conscious but I was obviously very VERY fucked up. My pupils were dilated and weren't responding to light, my speech was extremely slurred and my voice was extremely low, there was pink vomit all over the couch because I had thrown up but I had since crawled over to my bedroom and on my bed, I was moving at the pace of a sloth... my dad found me and the empty pill bottle behind me and one of the first things I remember him asking me was did the cat puke on the couch. (I think this might've been a bait question anyway since it was obvious it was mine.) I halfway shook my head yes just because I didn't have it in me at the moment because of my obviously severely overdosed state. He then asked me a couple questions later if I puked on the couch to which I then also halfway shook my head yes at. Then he got in a smart tone with me and said ""but you just said the cat puked on the couch, so you're a liar? huh? you're a liar."" He then shortly after a few questions I could barely answer called poison control asking them what to do and the lady at poison control said something along the lines of this is a very serious situation and to get me to the E.R. immediately. He then got very annoyed/frustrated. Note, that during this whole interaction, he did not once display any sense of urgency, panic, worry, concern, nothing like that. And as of this point, the only sense I picked up was something along the lines of annoyance or frustration. He then told me in a very annoyed or frustrated tone of voice ""All right, come on, get up, get dressed I have to take you to the E.R. now. 🙄 "" (I wasn't fully dressed, I'm pretty sure I was just in a t-shirt and underwear because I had just been comfy chilling at home all day.) He then left my room for a very short time period (probably less than a minute I'm guessing) and at this point I was starting to fade in and out of consciousness. I tried to stay awake and summon the strength to open my pants drawer and put pants on but I just wasn't in a state where I was capable of doing so. I could barely even move my hand across the bed. It just wasn't realistic. When my dad came back in my doorway to see me still laying in bed he then scolded me in an even more annoyed/frustrated tone of voice ""come on! get dressed!"" and then walked away again. I remember him coming to my doorway and saying that probably about 7 times with each time him sounding increasingly annoyed or frustrated. He was literally treating this literal life or death situation as if I was just simply refusing to get up for school or something. That moment and then a 1 second sight of the night sky is the last thing I remember from that night as I blacked out completely not too long after that. I think this moment really highlights his (probably immense) lack of empathy because how on earth could someone see someone else, yet alone their own kid, in such a state right in front of their eyes and still draw the conclusion that they're just choosing to defy their directions and get annoyed/frustrated with them for doing so? It took me going unconscious and unresponsive for him to call for help as he ended up calling an ambulance when that happened. Now, don't get me wrong, I completely understand his preference to drive me to the E.R. himself rather than call an ambulance because I live in the U.S. so medical bills, including ambulances, are insane here. I completely understanding wanting to cut them down whenever possible. But shouldn't someone realize when it's not possible? Did he value saving money over saving my life? Because the more time he spent kept coming around my doorway instead scolding me to get dressed instead of calling for help the more he delayed me receiving life saving medical attention which meant decreasing my chances at survival. 
Not only this moment though, but there's also one more moment that happened probably a week or a little more after a week after my suicide attempt that also bothers me as well. Where I live, whenever somebody gets hospitalized for any reason, if they have a primary care physican, then their primary care physician is notified of the hospitalization and has to schedule a mandatory 'emergency appointment' with the patient a little after they've been released from the hospital to discuss with them what happened that led to their admission to the hospital in the first place and to follow up check up on them and make sure they're still doing okay. My dad attended this appointment with me, was in the room with me the whole time, and was the one to retell the overdose story to my doctor. And he twisted the story of what actually happened. He didn't completely lie about it, but he added in details &amp; phrases that didn't actually happen &amp; that he didn't actually say to paint himself in the best light possible as well as he left some details out. (Sspecially the calling me a liar and scolding me to get dressed part because that would've made him look bad!) He told the story to her as if he was some superhero worthy of immense praise, and afterwards he kept telling me in a boasting tone of voice ""I saved your life! 😁""
All in all, I think this situation really showcased to me the type of person he really is.

Even though this happened a little while ago now, it still bothers me to this day whenever I think about it.
I&amp;#39;m 18 now, so obviously I made it through that moment, but when I was barely 16, I had my worst suicide attempt. It was 3 days after my 16th birthday. I overdosed on a very large amount of pills. I was home alone when I did it but my dad came home and found me about 20 mins later, I was still conscious but I was obviously very VERY fucked up. My pupils were dilated and weren&amp;#39;t responding to light, my speech was extremely slurred and my voice was extremely low, there was pink vomit all over the couch because I had thrown up but I had since crawled over to my bedroom and on my bed, I was moving at the pace of a sloth... my dad found me and the empty pill bottle behind me and one of the first things I remember him asking me was did the cat puke on the couch. (I think this might&amp;#39;ve been a bait question anyway since it was obvious it was mine.) I halfway shook my head yes just because I didn&amp;#39;t have it in me at the moment because of my obviously severely overdosed state. He then asked me a couple questions later if I puked on the couch to which I then also halfway shook my head yes at. Then he got in a smart tone with me and said &amp;quot;but you just said the cat puked on the couch, so you&amp;#39;re a liar? huh? you&amp;#39;re a liar.&amp;quot; He then shortly after a few questions I could barely answer called poison control asking them what to do and the lady at poison control said something along the lines of this is a very serious situation and to get me to the E.R. immediately. He then got very annoyed/frustrated. Note, that during this whole interaction, he did not once display any sense of urgency, panic, worry, concern, nothing like that. And as of this point, the only sense I picked up was something along the lines of annoyance or frustration. He then told me in a very annoyed or frustrated tone of voice &amp;quot;All right, come on, get up, get dressed I have to take you to the E.R. now. 🙄 &amp;quot; (I wasn&amp;#39;t fully dressed, I&amp;#39;m pretty sure I was just in a t-shirt and underwear because I had just been comfy chilling at home all day.)

,SuicideWatch,"TW mention of self harm and sexual abuseYo! All of my irl friends are busy and I struggle to ask for help. I think I need to vent to someone who won't make me feel as a burden? I don't know. Feeling awful. I was perfectly fine yesterday, but today I want to throw up and I'm super angry and snappy at everything. And right now I feel extremely anxious, to the point of thinking of suicide. I know it'll be over tomorrow, but right now I want to hurt myself. Punch my head or something. Or trying to hang myself to my work table to make my brain stop. I have my 2 year old's niece birthday in one hour and I feel like absolute shit, I'm afraid to have a panic attack in the middle of the family gathering.

I had a sexual intercourse with a friend with benefit last week, and I felt fine about it until now. I don't know why I feel awful only right now. We had a huge fight about some shit, and we decided to see each other last weekend to talk things out. Things going after another, we had sex, and the dude basically came in me without a condom, knowing I don't use hormonal contraception. Right after that, he left me to straight up to go take a shower. I had to take a morning pill on my own, he didn't even asked to take me to the pharmacy or if I was okay. Not even a hug, nothing. He just left me on the bed like a used sock. I felt like it was some kind of revenge, after our argument. And yesterday, a friend of mine (who is his ex... I live in a really small town.) told me how abusive he's been to her during their relationship. And right now I feel like shit. I'm disy, I feel like throwing up everyday. I'll take a pregnancy test next week, just in case my nausea doesn't come from anxiety. The intercourse, added to my friend's stories about the guy, made me think about past abuse from a man who raped me and that I've survived a while ago. Nothing makes sense.

I'm scared. I'm too old to live this kind of highschool drama bullshit for fuck sake. Why am I like this? I'm trying to quit smoking, find a job, lose weight, get my driver license, and everything is spinning around. I can't control anything. I want to cry and punch myself. I hate everything, I just want to see some friends and cry about how stupid I've been. My psychiatrist though I didn't need her services anymore, a second one think I might be autistic, and I hate everything right now. I just want to stay at home and cry with good friends and ice cream. But I have to be out with family, no friends, and I scream.

Edit : Some grammar.

Update : Feeling better. Less erratic and anxious. I had my periods yesterday, it’s so reassuring. I tried to talk to « my friend » about how I felt, and I told him I’ve been raped in the past. I haven’t been accusatory or even mad at him, I just wanted him to know how I felt if we ever did had fun together once again so we could see what’s okay to do and what is not. His first reaction was to give me excuses, then to tell me that maybe I lacked perspective, then to tell me that sometimes he didn’t want cuddles and just wanted a quick fuck, and then he just told me it was hypocritical to say that I felt used when we all use everyone in out life and yadayadayada. Lmao that guys is so ridiculously stupid. Psychopath. 

I’m going to focus a little more on my mental health. I thought I could see the red flags pretty early on, but apparently I’m still learning. I’m terrified my brain can so quickly go from 0 to « let’s kill yourself ». I still have that thoughts about how I waste ressources and oxygen by trying to exist normally and failing each time, but it’s not overwhelming. 

I wish to everyone who came across these words, all the kindness in the world, and I hope you guys feel okay and loved. At least I love you.

,SuicideWatch,"

I'm living for 17 whole years on this damn earth. Nothing... I got nothing for living, all I got is pain and resentment towards myself. Have no friends, and the ones, that I have are literally like only pity me.. nothing else! I am total trash! I've disappointed everyone who tried to talk to me, who counted on me... I am really a person who can ruin anything that the destiny give to. It's been more than a year that I'm struggling... I am ultra dead at social skills, walking style... I have always ended up by ruining Everything! I think I'm only making my parents to expect more and more than breaking those expectations to the rock bottom... I hate me so much! I have always been struggled bcz of lots of things... I got so much teased and insulted in my mid school years... 
Between my mom and dad, there were lots of conflicts... It's all actually my mom is like that... She was cheating on my father and... I am feeling embraced to share it all here but it was all so much worse when I was like 10. I never got courage to talk to them about shits were happening in my school since I hated my mom and knowing what had happened. My father has blood pressure problems after that. My uncle (my father's brother) had heart problems after all that happened. I don't want to share every explicit. It feels more embraced... But I was the person who was so much connected/intimated with her(my mom) b4 those things occurred. I always shared everything to her. And I was confident in those years. But after those matter between my parents, which was drawn to the divorce, but my father literally, begged my mom to get back... Even after knowing all what she had done, I stopped talking with her everything.. I talk, but only... Ahhhh! I never shared what was happening with me in school to my family. My father tried his best to not breaking the family... not getting me affected... but!!

Now, I am living in fear like what if one of those pigs(those who teased me and bullied me) will meet me in future? How will I deal with them? They will call me again by those hell like worst nicknames and I hate it when I think what will ppl think about me after hearing it? Why would anyone like to be girlfriend with this kinda loser? What if they call me by my that name in front of my family?my biggest fear is this one↑ idk how will I deal with it when my coworker will know my those name? I will not able to make a better image of mine..

Bcz of all that bullying and all, i lost my self-esteem and confidence. I think I'm social anxious too. I don't fit in with social interactions, always blunder somewhere. I can't feel comfortable talking with my close uncles too. I try to avoid social interactions most of the time. I think no-one values me at all... I'm just wasting all
.

Just a moment before, I was feeling that it was great that I never gave up! And later, I'm feeling like I should've killed myself.... I am not worthy to live.. I don't deserve to live.. I'm just wasting everything and... Just wasting! Just 6 mo ago, when some ppl gave me a new nickname, I hated it so much! I wasted my whole month, and almost everyday after school, I was having horrible thoughts to just end up. But sometimes crying, writting suicide notes, and sometimes bcz I got a girl as friend for the first time in my life...— like some reasons stopped me doing it. I never even was having courage to grab a knife in my hand to hurt myself... I just imagine all and think, nothing will happen if I die... I will hurt some ppl for awhile like my family.. then they will forget me as they should, and their life's Burdens like mine will be lightened from their shoulders. If I will live, I will only make their life worse and worse! 


I have even messed up my these two years which were so important for my career, I haven't prepared enough for an entrance exam... And showed that I am studying until mid night like 2-3 am but instead, actually I was playing call of duty whole day... I have betrayed my parents.

,SuicideWatch,"My older sister (50y/o) lives across the country from me. She has a history of being abused by her ex husband and has codependency issues. Lately she has been very down and yesterday on a phone call said that she wants to die. She wasn’t joking but didn’t seem distraught either. More irritated. I told her she shouldn’t say those things unless she means it and needs to seek help. She got mad at me and hung up. Of course that was stressful and I contacted her daughter (who lives with her) keep checking up on her without letting the daughter in on too much because that’s a lot for a teenager. She was fine and went to sleep and then I spoke to her this morning and she seemed “normal”.

Tonight I was talking to her again and she seemed down again. I was telling her what she needed to do to get in contact with a therapist and she said “it’s not that easy and no one helps me”. I told her that I would help but she needs to ask or we don’t know what she needs from us. I wasn’t getting frustrated with her but I was very much “to the point” and didn’t want to beat around the bush. She got mad again and hung up. I called her again and she rejected my call.

The point is - I don’t believe she is currently in danger of killing herself today. She is very afraid of dying and knows how traumatic that would be for her daughter. So I don’t want to call 911 and have someone sent out to her to take her to a hospital. She would be so upset at me and probably wouldn’t trust me with these feelings again.

It’s a daunting task when you’re in the middle of it. Honestly I don’t know if I have the courage to kill myself, but I do desperately crave to not feel, not exist anymore. Happy birthday to me I guess&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I'm constantly anxious. My meds don't help. None of the meds help. They just make it so I can't sleep. One made me unable to sleep for almost 3 full days. I had to take a tylenol pm and a valium in order to sleep. 

I'm anxious about getting a remote job. I have to take care of my mother every day but don't get paid because she was retired before her strokes that turned her back into a 12yo. So I need a job I can be home and do. But I don't have any college degree. I worked retail for the last 10 years since I was 20. I'm too old to go back to school. I'm not good with people. I'm not good at math. I get so anxious about phone calls I want to throw up. But if I don't get a job I'm going to lose my Healthcare. Even the idea of writing a resume gives me anxiety tummy for days. 

My boyfriend is afraid of commitment, and that makes me so anxious I want to die. I have been raped and abused in the past, so I'm terrified to try to date again. I don't want anyone but him, and I've never been more sure of anything than he's the one, but he can't even commit to a weekend trip away. He still has his wedding ring tattoo from his ex-wife. It makes me worry he's still in love with her. And wonder if that's why he won't commit to me. I'm anxious that I'm not good enough or pretty enough or thin enough for him. I know he likes busty petite blondes, which I am not. He started working overnights 6months ago so I never get to talk to him. He wakes up, eats and showers, goes to work, is too busy at work for more than a quick ❤️ emoji. He doesn't get to take his lunch, which I'm awake for anyway, so I can't even talk to him during that. Then he gets home and goes to sleep. On his 2 nights off I usually go over for 1 of them. I live an hour away so he usually wakes up at 5 or 6pm and then I drive the hour there. We're awake together for a few hours and then I pass out. When I am awake with him I'm massaging him for hours because of his chronic pain. I don't mind doing it but i worry that and sex are the only reason I'm kept around. Then when I wake up I have to rush home to take care of my mom. His other night off I usually get like 3 or 4 messages from him and that's it. He has adhd so he forgets his phone exists and so he forgets I exist. He gets too into making music or watching stuff about space. I know he's not cheating because his mom lives with him while she gets her green card. And she's very religious and wouldn't tolerate him committing adultery.

One of my best friends suddenly dropped off the face of the earth, turned off his cell service, deleted all his social media, quit all his gaming platforms.... I have no idea if he's alive or dead and no way to contact him. He lives across the country and I never met or talked to any of his family. 

My mom had knee replacement surgery in December and still can barely walk. She's had physical and occupational therapy in a rehab center, at home, and next week we start out patient. If she never walks again I'm going to be stuck here forever taking care of her. My dad won't retire. He's working full time still, and does usually like 5 hours of side jobs after that. So he essentially comes home, eats dinner, and goes to bed. I'm stuck. She won't do her exercises at home. She won't walk unless it's to the bathroom. And then she waits until the last minute because she doesn't wanna walk any more than she has to. So she's constantly wetting and soiling herself which means more laundry for me to do. I'm the only one who does laundry or dishes or takes care of the dogs. I try to clean but my dad's a hoarder so the house is full of his shit. And if I throw anything away he either digs it out of the trash or yells at me about how important that item was for something. If I do clean he never cleans up after himself so whatever I cleaned gets trashed in like a day or two. I have to force my mom to take showers because it's so tiring for her. Plus her strokes made her think some kpop guy is in love with her so I find her messaging scam accounts every other week. No matter how many times I explain that they aren't him she still does it. No matter how much I tell her it's hurting me that she won't stop- she keeps doing it. She tried to give them $5k and I had to stop it. 

The only good things in my life are the dogs, the cat, the volunteering with animals I do once a week. It's unpaid and they can't afford to pay me. It's also the only time I get to see it talk to my best friend of 20 years. Or just sit in quiet. And my ~12 hours with my boyfriend, a portion of which I'm asleep during. Because being next to him makes me feel calm when nothing else does. But he won't even say he'd like to live with me eventually because his ex- wife fucked him up so bad he's afraid of commitment to the extreme. 

I never get a break from the anxiety. I get like 5 hours of sleep a night if I'm lucky. When I do sleep it's anxiety dreams or nightmares about my few supports leaving me. I don't really eat unless my dad brings home takeout or my bf buys me dinner on our night together. The energy it takes to make myself food just isn't there. I already have to make every meal for my mom and the pets. I've had baby carrots or toast for dinner more times than I can count. I can't enjoy any of my hobbies anymore. The anxiety screams at me the whole time that i should be getting a job or cleaning or laundry or anything else. It's always in my head. Screaming at me that the only way out is to die. That I'll never be anything more than this hamster on a wheel. Nothing helps. Nothing fixes it. I just sit here and cry, and I feel guilty for doing that because it's not productive. I have AuDHD but my insurance won't pay for me to get diagnosed and it's $7.5k for me to get official testing without accepted insurance. So I have no meds for that. I feel like my heart is going to give out every night as I sit there and look at my life. Almost every choice I've ever made was wrong. I was supposed to kill myself when I turned 18 but I chickened out. Then at 20, 22, 25, 28, 30... I just can't do it. Too many people need me and I'm so tired. I'm so so so tired. Nothing helps.

He gets too into making music or watching stuff about space. I know he&amp;#39;s not cheating because his mom lives with him while she gets her green card. And she&amp;#39;s very religious and wouldn&amp;#39;t tolerate him committing adultery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my best friends suddenly dropped off the face of the earth, turned off his cell service, deleted all his social media, quit all his gaming platforms.... I have no idea if he&amp;#39;s alive or dead and no way to contact him. He lives across the country and I never met or talked to any of his family. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom had knee replacement surgery in December and still can barely walk. She&amp;#39;s had physical and occupational therapy in a rehab center, at home, and next week we start out patient. If she never walks again I&amp;#39;m going to be stuck here forever taking care of her. My dad won&amp;#39;t retire. He&amp;#39;s working full time still, and does usually like 5 hours of side jobs after that. So he essentially comes home, eats dinner, and goes to bed. I&amp;#39;m stuck. She won&amp;#39;t do her exercises at home. She won&amp;#39;t walk unless it&amp;#39;s to the bathroom. And then she waits until the last minute because she doesn&amp;#39;t wanna walk any more than she has to. So she&amp;#39;s constantly wetting and soiling herself which means more laundry for me to do. I&amp;#39;m the only one who does laundry or dishes or takes care of the dogs. I try to clean but my dad&amp;#39;s a hoarder so the house is full of his shit. And if I throw anything away he either digs it out of the trash or yells at me about how important that item was for something. If I do clean he never cleans up after himself so whatever I cleaned gets trashed in like a day or two. I have to force my mom to take showers because it&amp;#39;s so tiring for her. Plus her strokes made her think some kpop guy is in love with her so I find her messaging scam accounts every other week. No matter how many times I explain that they aren&amp;#39;t him she still does it. No matter how much I tell her it&amp;#39;s hurting me that she won&amp;#39;t stop- she keeps doing it. She tried to give them $5k and I had to stop it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only good things in my life are the dogs, the cat, the volunteering with animals I do once a week. It&amp;#39;s unpaid and they can&amp;#39;t afford to pay me. It&amp;#39;s also the only time I get to see it talk to my best friend of 20 years. Or just sit in quiet. And my ~12 hours with my boyfriend, a portion of which I&amp;#39;m asleep during. Because being next to him makes me feel calm when nothing else does. But he won&amp;#39;t even say he&amp;#39;d like to live with me eventually because his ex- wife fucked him up so bad he&amp;#39;s afraid of commitment to the extreme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never get a break from the anxiety. I get like 5 hours of sleep a night if I&amp;#39;m lucky. When I do sleep it&amp;#39;s anxiety dreams or nightmares about my few supports leaving me. I don&amp;#39;t really eat unless my dad brings home takeout or my bf buys me dinner on our night together. The energy it takes to make myself food just isn&amp;#39;t there. I already have to make every meal for my mom and the pets. I&amp;#39;ve had baby carrots or toast for dinner more times than I can count. I can&amp;#39;t enjoy any of my hobbies anymore. The anxiety screams at me the whole time that i should be getting a job or cleaning or laundry or anything else. It&amp;#39;s always in my head. Screaming at me that the only way out is to die. That I&amp;#39;ll never be anything more than this hamster on a wheel. Nothing helps. Nothing fixes it. I just sit here and cry, and I feel guilty for doing that because it&amp;#39;s not productive. I have AuDHD but my insurance won&amp;#39;t pay for me to get diagnosed and it&amp;#39;s $7.5k for me to get official testing without accepted insurance. So I have no meds for that. I feel like my heart is going to give out every night as I sit there and look at my life. Almost every choice I&amp;#39;ve ever made was wrong. I was supposed to kill myself when I turned 18 but I chickened out. Then at 20, 22, 25, 28, 30... I just can&amp;#39;t do it. Too many people need me and I&amp;#39;m so tired. I&amp;#39;m so so so tired. Nothing helps. I&amp;#39;m stuck in fucking eternal hell. The only way out is to die.&lt;/p&gt;

I want to die
I don't deserve to be here
It hurts
I am a loser I am sick of the world 
It's rot.

Hello. I'm M17 and my first experience with self warn were some self scratches in my arm because of stress and anxiety.
In the past November I started doing it with a knife. An the motive for that wasn't majority because of stress but because of suicide thoughts and a big chest pain.
I started with only some cuts in the arm but then there was one time that I didn't had space in the arm to cut myself so I decided to cut myself in the other arm. But it wasn't the same so I did that on top of the other cuts, they weren't very deep in the arm but I did it a lot.
I had some sessions between November and December, some weeks I did 3 times, others i did just once because I had Fisical education and I needed to show my arms so to not alert the teachers and my parents I returned a little with the scratches bit I just wanted to do with the knife.
In the last session 14 of December I did the cuts with more deep and I wanted to start doing in other parts of my body and with more regularity but....in the next day my mother saw one of the cuts.
Then my family started doing some caution with me.
I went in an pedopsychiatrist and in the first appointment I has prescribed with setriline and in the next with respiredone.
I had almost every week an psychologist appointment.

I want to die and the medicine was an effect on me, I don't like it, I feel the pain but I don t want to cut myself so often.
I am very happy since setrilina, like euphoria and I hate it but at the same time i think i lost some feelings i became more cold.

That's it I am going to continue writing here and in r/selfharm even if no one sees this, if anyone have similar experiences I want to know, I don't want to be alone no one understands...

,SuicideWatch,"I attempted suicide when I was 14. I'm still suicidal at age 22. Things are better, I won't discredit that, but they aren't good. I cope with it through art and fiction most of the time. It's not reality, but I like to hope I'll get better one day like the characters I read about. Or alternatively, I can make art of suffering instead of doing bad things to myself. 

I snagged tonight on the line, ""He realized a few weeks ago that he was glad he hadn't managed to kill himself.""

I still don't feel that way. I've talked to my therapist a lot about how deeply I wish I had died when I was 14. I've lived 8 years after I planned. Despite that span of time being so long, nothing has managed to make me feel glad to be alive. 

It's 4 AM here. I'm awake this late because of insomnia. I'm starting with a sleep medication that is less effective but has less side effects. So far it's not working. It's not helping the nightmares either. I think every night as I'm going to not-sleep about how badly I want to hurt myself. I think about different suicide methods. My headspace is just filled with screaming all the time and a sense of agony at the fact that I'm still fucking alive. I feel like I'm inches away from having a breakdown in public. I don't know how I'm managing to still wake up and go about life like everything is normal and fine. All I think about are the ways I can hurt myself, destroy myself, inflict unique kinds of pain so I can stave it off. 

I think about giving up and losing all self control sometimes. It's a stupid thought. I accidentally yelled at one of my abusers three days ago. I felt so guilty over it that I was nauseous for hours. If I actually gave into every impulse and started screaming, crying, bleeding, speaking honestly about how I feel, I'd regret it. I hate that. I wish I didn't have the urge or that I could just give up and stop struggling. Instead I'm in so much pain with no way to express it. 

I'm not glad that I survived my suicide attempt. Every day I wish I had succeeded. I'm so angry that I'm still alive. More than that, I feel lonely and just pathetically sad about it. I just want to stop hurting. I want someone to give a shit not just about whether I live or die, but about the quality of my life and mind right now. I keep living hoping that one day this will change, that life is a gift I'll cherish. 8 years in and there's been no luck. Will it be 8 years more before I change my mind? 16? 24? Will I die before I reach that point?

All I know is right now I'm very tired and I wish I could go the fuck to sleep.

ive posted in the sub before in february and i had people in my dms telling me to hold on but i genuinely cant anymore. ive been trying different methods and nothing is actually working. i have been contemplating posting my address on all social medias so that i could be killed but i live with my family and even though they treat me like shit my sucicidal thoughts shouldnt have to harm them, physically at least. 

im trying my best to hold on because apparently everyone else in my life will be sad (more like guilty). i don’t believe this because ive never been treated like im human; i’ve been abused mentally, physically, and sexually(distant family and a guy at school before i graduated), my mother has always described me as the devil although i act just like her except i try my hardest to be the happiest and nicest i can be. 

i know my friends would be sad and im really sorry for them but i really just have to put myself first. i put everyone else’s happiness over mine for the longest time. im not even hard to please, im more of a spending time kind of person and i prefer to stay in watching movies and whatnot whenever possible.

i honestly have everything a normal person could want, a big house, clothes, shoes.. i just lack in the emotional aspect, i just wanted to be loved. i have never been genuinely loved by anyone, including family. im grateful for everything i have because i know things have been worse.

Tried hanging myself but was too afraid of the fan falling down or something and quit.

Will graduate high school in a few days and currently giving university entrances. And they always like to think they know what's best for me, like my first entrance didn't go well and while the second one was better, it won't get me anywhere, and so they have presented me the two options:

1. Go and work at my grandfathers' shop
2. Enter a shitty university

I don't want to take any of these and if given freedom will choose to take 1 more year preparing for the entrances. But that most likely won't be possible.

And of course, they want to compare me with my friends and the kids of their friends, for the last 2 months, I have only heard curses and ""this friend got this many marks"" from their mouths. And obviously, they only compare the thing at which I'm bad. In the aspects in which I'm better, they ask why am I comparing myself to others as if they don't do it every day.

My hair has receded a bit and one tooth has a cavity, and yeah I didn't really take care of myself as a kid but now whenever I try to take care of my hair and teeth, they have a problem with it, saying why didn't you do this earlier. Like they didn't have a problem when I was not doing it but now when I am trying to get better, they want to go 'I-told-u-so' every fucking time. And they always want to try some ""natural products"" which they saw on TV, or Youtube on me instead of seeing a doctor.

Every day is just filled with curses, impossible expectations, and threats. I can't go on any longer, but just cutting myself with a box cutter scares me. Hell, I'm even afraid of hanging myself as I don't know what would happen if something failed and I survived.

I lay in bed all day, i try to get motivation but my mind is starting to mistaken my depression for “laziness”, i feel disgusting, not sure why, maybe its the mess. or maybe its my lack of self confidence, i am not yet sure to know. i struggle to get up for school daily, its a main part of my life at this age. but at this age i’m debating suicide. and do not have time for schoolwork. my father yells through my door to clean my room, as it is filthy. its not like he knows what i feel, how scarred my arms are, how much i cry. he doesn’t know. so screw him.

i look at my cat, who’s suffering due to my suffering, i feel like a shit owner, probably am. poor thing is suffering due to my own problems. wish he had a better life, that itself makes me hate myself more than anyone else could. Im on my phone all the time, i only get support online. by a boyfriend, he doesn’t know how to help my life, not sure he even knows who i am, i don’t know who i am either. just my age, fourteen.

I have officially given up on this thing called life. It has been one hell of a ride, but I simply cannot go on.

I just need to get a witness to sign.

My plan is to book a flight to a random destination - likely the cheapest flight the airport has that day.

Once I land, I will grab one last drink before I exit the airport - hopefully a Macallan 12 or 18.

Then I will proceed to dispose of my personal belongings and any identifiable affects in a random waste bin in the suburbs.

I will then find the highest altitude water-crossing in that area, within reasonable commuting distance of the city I land in.

Once I arrive at the nearest commuter stop to said crossing, I will exit the method of transportation that brought me there, then proceed to walk until I am at the center of the crossing.

Finally, I will position myself on the outer edge, close my eyes, say a prayer, and take the last leap of my life.

I pray my friends and family find closure. I am sorry I was not enough for you all, not enough for myself. This… this is my closure, for myself.

,SuicideWatch,"I have come to a realization: none of my problems matter. Not my depression, not my anxiety, not my adhd, not anything. Because none of those are going to solve the biggest one: I will never be financially independent. I'll never achieve the dream of not worrying 24/7 about finances. I'll never own a home. I'll never retire. All I can do is sit here and watch my bank account approach zero.  

I've got no marketable skills, no job prospects, and even if I could magically do college after dropping out last time that's YEARS away from only barely addressing a problem that's hitting me in a matter of months at best. Maybe I'll find another shit job, delay the inevitable a bit, but I have yet to find a job that hasn't pushed me to a suicide attempt. Nobody is paying enough for me to spend all day doing nothing but contemplate the end. 

Existing is far too expensive for my blood. I would prefer to opt out. Not today, but that day is getting ever closer.

,SuicideWatch,I have managed to push everyone who tried to love me away. Long story short I felt very suffocated by my parents growing up as I was an only child and they always controlled my life. I am very empathetic with people and tend to let people release all their emotions burdens on me even if it hurts me (bc I believe I can overcome anything due to my history). I got into a relationship and felt empowered to move out at 21 as I was depressed and felt mistreated and the relationship grew toxic and I started to feel alone in my homesickness so I began to push this person away. I didn’t talk to my parents for two years and my mum has stopped calling and now my relationship has ended because I pushed this persons final limit by being mean to him when I felt he was ignoring my messages for days. I don’t have any friends nor am I used to asking for help either. I woke up this morning and realised that I have pushed everyone that tried to love me away and I’m afraid that nobody is ever going to forgive me so I think I shouldn’t bother trying to reconcile. I did all this to feel autonomous cus I tend to put people first and now I feel selfish and evil. I feel like I might die early.
