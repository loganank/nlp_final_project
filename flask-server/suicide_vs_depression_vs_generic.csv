"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement","We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. 

Thanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.",SQLwitch,251,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cz6nfd/new_wiki_on_how_to_avoid_accidentally_encouraging/
Please remember that NO ACTIVISM of any kind is ever allowed here. No matter what day it is.,"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide is, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times. 

Please understand that we're all for smart, strategic mental-health and suicide-prevention activism. It's essential to fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and to fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding. Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL. 

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population. We used to allow it but the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming.  We do regret the need for this rule, but the need is inescapable. 

Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our community's wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

**tl;dr** Any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's about any cause or issue (rather than a request for personal support) is not allowed here.  Please report everything of the nature that you see.",SQLwitch,43,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pl9suy/please_remember_that_no_activism_of_any_kind_is/

Lost my partner to suicide,"It's been about 8 months and it's only getting worse. I was the one who found the body, and my life has been extremely turbulent to say the least...

I'm envious of those who are loved,"I used to be loved. I had parents, a spouse, in laws, aunts, uncles.   


Death took many, divorce took the rest, and I can conclusively say, there is no one on this earth that loves me. That is pathetic, I am aware. If only people actually realized how impossible it is to live when nobody really cares whether or not you exist.   


Well... thats harsh. Of course a few people care that I exist. Some would even cry if I died. But our relationship is transactional. We get something from each other. We don't love one another. They would get over it.  


Suicide seems so obvious.   


Why bother trying so hard....to ""work on myself""  
to ""improve my apperance""  
""improve my mental health""   
""improve my attitude""   
""Get out in the community""   


Its all for the same thing, to find someone new to love me. I fucking resent that I have to put in effort if I want this basic human thing. So many people have it and they don't even understand how precious it is. So many people who are actually pieces of shit are still loved by someone.  I try to treat everyone with kindness, and I try to treat them the way I would want to be treated and I know I'm not perfect but I do try and It just angers me to no end that for some reason I am not deserving of love.   


Soon enough I am going to kill myself Probably when my cat dies as he is the last thing that In theory loves me at least to the extent animals do, although is it really love? it feels like the love of an animal is real but the truth is, he would be go on and be happy and well fed living with one of my few friends..

I wish there was a way to die without hurting anyone.,"I don’t wanna hurt anyone anymore, and I know my death would do exactly that to many I’m absolutely undeservingly lucky to be loved by. Everyday I think about the need I have to punish myself for the pain I’ve caused some amazing people who’ve chosen to trust me over and over until everything was ruined completely, by my fault and no one else’s. I need to prove to myself that I am, in fact, sorry. I need to prove to myself that I, in fact, cared. I need to prove to myself that I hate myself enough, hate myself as much as I claim to do. That at least in my hatred for myself I’m sincere and honest. I need to punish myself, but the thing is, while you pursue self-punishment, in reality those unfortunate to care about you are the ones who get punished way more harshly: be it your family that wants to see you getting better, your friends that count on your to be there, or your pet that will be looking for you everywhere in confusion once you’re gone…

Life's a rigged game,"Once you reach a certain age, it's easy to see that the concept of destiny is truer than you can imagine. If you are born ""broken"", without certain vital ""assets"" and without access to real opportunities to fix things, you are destined to experience a scarred life that will slowly destroy you completely.

After spending decades just trying to find my place in life, the only conclusion I can come to is that it wasn't worth it. All the times I've tried to look at life in a hopeful light and strive to pursue happiness, all I've accomplished is sinking deeper. In recent years, I've even tried to kill myself, but it seems I'm chained to this endless nightmare until what little sanity I have left is gone.

Meanwhile, I continue failing to achieve the bare minimum, while the problems and my suffering continue to grow and are summarily ignored by the world around me, including by people who should care about my well-being, but all they manage to do is throw me more deep in the abyss.

I’ve fought for myself every day and I’m trapped. I’m too tired.,"I’m currently suicidal. I’ve been throughout my life but not like this. It’s darkdark this time. This is honestly the first post I’ve ever made on reddit, and it’s because I’m looking for some people who know how this feels and who have hopefully been able to overcome it. I’ve been depressed from adolescence, medicated in my late teens, switched around and around nothing worked. These past three months have been so dark. Dealing with my SA - binge eating heavily - trying to do well in school but never able to do anything. I feel lazy but I know I’m just depressed. I finally sought help for myself by getting tested for ADHD, I think it might explain some of my combined symptoms. I did the test and the results are skewed because I do have the ADHD indicators, but my depression is so high the psychologist had to refer me to a psychiatrist for a proper diagnosis. At this point that appointment was all I could live for, it’s my beacon of hope after all these years of struggling SSRIs SSNRIs with no help I could finally find some true clarity, a medication that works considering my psych eval. The day before my appointment my psychiatrist cancelled on me and it was the straw that broke the camels back. He rescheduled- but everything is so bleak I don’t feel like I can make it to the appointment at the end of the month. It’s been 3 days since then, and I spent yesterday in the emergency psychiatric assessment wing at the mental hospital. They kept me there for 8 hours and sent me home with a prescription for an SSRI I’ve already taken and moved on from in the past (which he knew). He said it will take 6 weeks to get the desired effect (which I also know) but I told him the reason I was there is because I don’t have that kind of time. Every day is so hard and I don’t want to keep fighting. I know I can go back and stay if I need to but I don’t know what I need. My brain can’t make decisions. The only relief I feel is when I cause myself pain. I don’t enjoy or have motivation to use my usual coping strategies that have gotten me this far. I need immediate help. The mental health services in the country below the Arctic circle are abysmal. I don’t know what I need - to vent - advice - I don’t know. I know I should live until the end of the month.

I just have to get it off my chest.,"Hey internet strangers. Throw away because I don't want this tied to my main account.

It's been a rough year. My brother died. You don't have to say sorry for it; it is what it is and it's not your fault, the world is just cruel. He was 30. He didn't get to see me turn twenty. I miss him every day. It drives me insane. Sometimes I'll forget it for a moment, when I see something I'd like to tell him about - then, like being hit by a truck, I realize I can't. I can't ever tell him. I can't ever show anything to him ever again. He's gone.

I've hated this world long before he passed, but the grief has made coping a lot harder with my already abysmal outlook on life. I shouldn't be as depressed as I am. I'm in a good place, dead siblings aside. But I don't feel like I'm ever going to get anywhere in life. I never did. I have no passion for anything. I have no desire to move forward, be part of the world, to work, to meet new people, to witness the atrocities of the human race. Any of it.

I just want to see my brother again.

I don't want to struggle to make enough money to survive. I don't want to fight life at every turn anymore. I just don't have the energy for it. I just want to see him again. I want to be done. I'm over it.

This isn't to say I'm writing a suicide letter right now. I'm not going to do it, despite all the fantazing. Would I be unhappy if a bus hit me tomorrow? No. But I'm not going to go out of my way to die. I just feel so awful, and I'm so tired, and on top of that, I miss him so much. I am going nowhere in life, and I miss him so much.

I am going to kill myself on May 27th.,"I’m 22 years old and I’m glad I could live for this long, unfortunately, there’s nothing I can do anymore that won’t keep me in a state of unbearable pain. I’ve tried to approach a sort of life-affirming philosophy but it slowly sunk in that the only peace I’ll ever bring to this world is by no longer being there. In fact, the correct thing to do was to someway rewind reality to make sure I never ever even existed, but we all know that is not possible.

I’m glad I could experience the joy of Being, which, just in case you’re reading this and feeling there cannot be grace in life, is completely possible, the painfully nature of Being is not at all excluding of it’s grace. 

However, when it comes to me, the pain is just too much to bear with, and the returns I get for being alive right now are nothing but simply a vague and very weak faith in the mercifulness of God. But if anything I’ve learned about all useless philosophy I’ve read about I can assure that He’s not present at all, as all I can feel and do is evil.

Due to this very wicked nature of mine I’ve built my own downfall, I used to have multiple friends that I could count on, now I don’t have any. I used to have a partner that I would spend the rest of my life with. That person’s gone, at least metaphorically. I used to have a promising future and path ahead of me. That’s also gone. All of which are simply reflections on what I myself did to lose it all. The time I’m spending on the brief time I’m still around won’t be either to change or repent or whatever, but rather to ensure nothings going to go wrong this time. Everything is already set up and I won’t be leaving any digital footprints from now on. 

To everyone that made my 22 years on this planet possible and graceful, thank you. Congratulations for still being alive and proclaiming your right to live.",TsukiZZZ,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12cwfey/i_am_going_to_kill_myself_on_may_27th/
Why Woman coworker constantly upset about that I'm quiet ?,"I've tried posting it on dating advice they won't let me for whatever reason . I figured ivlm come hear for insight or maybe you guys have experience with this. You're right I just don't understand why she keeps saying I'm too quiet I do talk to her but I just like to be professional being that this is work maybe if it was somewhere else I would speak more but I'm naturally a introvert . I know how to speak sometime people assume quiet people can't speak , We just articulate in a different way maybe it's because I have asd I'm working on it so maybe it be as quiet . Then another thing I told her I don't want to talk out of my but just to talk . When I talk too you I want to provide you something to leave with . I just don't want to talk just to talk . She doesn't know I have autism though because autism affect some social skills but I'm getting better at it .Sorry for assuming you was mad. she often calls me bestie , king , she keeps asking me if I'm annoyed I keep telling her . No I'm not annoyed I told her that I'm just quiet . People that really know me family members or friends they know this is how I've always been I told her it can change Then she told me change now. How can I change in one second? It takes time. She always shouts out my name . But I feel it's too good to be true because I'm a slim African American but I m am putting on some more weight and muscle. She is Spanish but plus size I don't have a problem with plus but I know some women don't like to be bigger than men . Not all of them like though. Plus she has her car already . That's something I'm working on too and maybe she have her own place she showed it too a customer. I think she is out of my league anyway and she says I'm too quiet even though explaining to her I thought she was cool . I have just change the quietness . Plus I lost mother at 15 in 2015 to Fredreich Ataxia. Now I caretqke for 29 year old sister she caught the fa from my mother. But these are things she doesn't know about me maybe if she did maybe she will see why I'm so quiet. I don't know just don't want to talk out of my butt. Its not going to genuine . I want to give value to a conversation. Not gibberish . If I just talk to talk I won't have nothing good to say. And my words wont match my actions if I do that. I won't be about what I say I'm  about. Sorry for the essay lol I'm just venting . Its just frustrating because I liked but I'm just too quiet or not good enough for a relationship i don't mind friendship though . Its like damned if I do damned if I don't . Its always something to point out about me . I really do the best I can . She tried to claim she made me blush . Weird. Even today she said you are going to buy me some shoes? Lol like im her boyfriend are something but I know I'm not that it's just the way she says things are so secdutctive . Unless she is like this with all men I don't know . I don't see her talking like that with the other male Co-workers . She told me she is a 6 and a half in sneakers. "" Don't worry it's not expensive""  I'm not even in a relationship with her but she talks like it's like that. She even asked are you going to buy me flowers? Its crazy . Then she says do you miss me . Then if I don't say it back she gives me a defensive stare then I say it them she smiles or she may gaslight me and say I'm lieing. I noticed if I don't talk to her , she would tell me ""oh you're so rude you can't say hi . Basically I can't walk past without saying hi . But I know alot of people are like that though even dudes get mad if you don't say something to them walking past.  She always try to make a conversation . Even she told me "" I will always find a way to find you.  She says she is tired of me saying the same thing , she wants to hear something new.? I told her I will say it naturally and not forced . She sucked her teeth and got mad. If I'm in a aile I ve noticed how she is able to get out of the deli counter and come to me , and I'm like how did you get into this aile especially if there were customers. I work in grocery and dairy though , the store is small so that's probably why we bump into each other, despite working different departments.

"""Is this life worth living?"" is The Question.","The question popped into my head around six years ago. Every type of media answers loudly: yes, yes, and yes! Occasionally, you can see a 'no', but only in something at least slightly obscure or, even more often, you can get a 'no' but then people discover that they were wrong, and it's 'yes'.

Well, my initial response to the self-posed question was no, and it surprised me. Maybe it shouldn't have since most people who would answer affirmatively wouldn't even start pondering the question. So, I explored why I think this way and found many answers, some more personal than others. Life consists of struggle and strife, suffering engulfs it while happiness is fleeting. Some people commit suicide in an emotional state without thinking it through, but it was my logic, not emotions, that made me think that committing suicide may be an expression of one's worldview where it simply **is** rational.

Do I think all lives are not worth living? Yes **and** no. The world seems to be devoid of meaning, and in that sense nothing is worth it, but on a personal level, you might invent or find value in your own life. Me, with my life - I can't.

The only counterargument is that choosing not to live is permanent. Such an important decision should be extremely well thought through. What if my logic is flawed? I've made many mistakes in the past, but taking my own life would be the one that no one can ever undo. Is this a paradox? Thinking that suicide is a logical thing to do, but not committing because of the smallest chance that it isn't?

I've read *The Myth of Sisyphus* by Albert Camus recently. And **he** phrases it like that in the beginning: the matter of suicide is The Question, because every other question doesn't make sense until you answer this one. Despite being a bright philosopher and an accomplished writer, Camus didn't convince me of the intrinsic value of life. But the importance of The Question stayed with me, among other things, and it explained some of my behavior and thought process.

For six years, I've been in two states: thinking about dying and distracting myself from thoughts about dying. I can't move on. I can't do anything worthwhile with my life because I don't see a point and maybe I don't see a point because there's nothing worthwhile in my life. Maybe, it would be best for me to discover that I was wrong, but I have no idea how. People on the other side just don't make sense. When I get tired of trying to understand other points of view or of thinking the same thoughts agian and again, I just distract myself, with chores, videogames, memes, etc. Anything fast and stimulating because otherwise the thoughts persist. Sometimes, The Question morphs into ""Is it possible to make life worth living?"" or ""How to make life worth living?"" or ""How other people determine if their lives are worth living?"" I can't stop wondering but it always comes back to the root and the same answer.

I can't think of an ending to this post. I wrote it to get it out of my head and maybe read some opinions or thoughts on this, whether you agree or disagree. Perhaps, my whole  point has been obvious to you for years now, but it's a revelation to me. Thank you for reading. Well, the ending turned out better than I expected.",kitsuneguuji,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12cwx9s/is_this_life_worth_living_is_the_question/

I want to be gone.,"I never wanted something in my life other than my death. The only thing that will actually help me and finally be silenced forever. No more sleepless nights no more failed pathetic attempts.  The people to the eternal void inside me. To my eternal numbness. No more stupid generic advice from therapists, no more locked up in the mental hospital. Even if life has so much more to offer, i really just don't care anymore. Even if my life was somehow magically turned around, somehow it would continue to gradually get worse and worse. It's the endless cycle which i can't break, simply because it's unbroken and it will never be separated. The constant anguish and the neverending hours of day pass only to grow even more dead. It's something i can't really uphold nor risk. For once i want to be gone and erased for good. Not just me being dust that only gets more and more pieces that just irritates.  I worked hard and everything went the completely opposite way. It won't hurt anyone or literally no one will be bothered by my death. It's just how my life goes. Second by second, minute by minute, hour after hour, day by day it will always get worse and worse. I'm already dead inside so it's time my stiched body has its goodbye.

Today is the day,"I made this account because I'm tired of bottling up how I feel. Today is the day I plan on ending my life. I don't exactly know what time, but it's 8pm at the time I'm writing this. 

Growing up, I've only really had my mom. My father has been in and out of jail all of my life and I never got the chance to have a relationship with him. My mother isn't the greatest, in fact, she's the worst. She's been abusing me for as long as I could remember. She would beat me for the smallest things. Not with a belt or shoe or anything you'd expect a child to be beaten with. She'd beat me with cords and wires. Sometimes she'd even strangle me with them. If I ran, she'd use my jump ropes to tie me to chairs and strip me naked just to beat me. She would often take me by surprise when I was bathing, which made the beatings 10 times worse. I was afraid of her, terrified. Even being in the same room as her was enough to make me a nervous wreck. I can't even get into everything she's ever done to me in such a short period of time. Cps hardly ever got involved. I was taken away once, they sent me to life with my aunt for a bit. But of course, I still ended up in her custody.

I'm sixteen now, and things haven't gotten any better. She's still terrible, but she's a lot worse now. You see, when I was younger I was very smart. I was the top of my class throughout elementary school, and my mother made sure everyone knew how smart I was. Unfortunately, as I grew older I fell into a deep depression. In result my grades slipped drastically. I practically failed my way through middle school. The only thing that saved me from repeating was the pandemic. I'm in my second year of high school, in the final quarter, and my grades haven't improved a bit. This makes my mother treatment towards me even worse. Two days ago, my mother stabbed me. It wasn't anything too bad, I just needed stitches in my leg. That whole situation really made me think; why should I even be alive? My own mother doesn't love me, she's told me multiple times that she WANTED me to kill myself. My father doesn't seem to have any interest in me. I'm not really close to any other family, but I doubt they want anything to do with me either. I have no friends. It's not like I have much of a future for myself. No one would miss me. So why am I still here?

If anyone is reading this, I would like to thank you. I'm sorry if it doesn't make much sense I'm not exactly the best writer. I'm not sure how I'm going to end it. I don't really know the easiest way to commit suicide. I'm sorry for beinf the way that I am",kywmi,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12d30a0/today_is_the_day/

It will chew you up and spit you out if you let it take control, and even if you try to fight back there is always a greater force out there praying on your downfall. People don’t care about each other and those who do care can’t genuinely help you because they’re dealing with their own issues.

I got bullied since i think i joined school well somewhere like that. I was always angry after i got home from school just want to add that. I had 2 friends i knew my whole life. We were the 3 best friends, oh well atleast thats what i thought. One of them joined the ""cool kids"" and the other one talked behind my back. I thought maybe we could be better friends like before but they threw me away and started bullying me with the WHOLE school. I didnt even realise at all. I tried and tried to be friends with them again, nothing worked. In middle school i was bullied for being skinny, dumb and naive. I knew they were talking behind my back, but what could i have done? I wanted to be cool and have atleast one friend. Even if they are fake, i would have done everything for them. One day i stopped going to school for one year. I gained some weight and never went outside at all. I got used to being scared and shy to go outside and my depression, and anger issues got worse. I went to clinics and clinics. They didnt really pay attention to any kids there. So it was pretty useless spending months in those clinics. Im gonna get to the point now, i daydream,i get lost in fake scenarious i hope i spelled that right ,i fight with my mother and brother and i go to an all girls school now.Its also for people with problems like me. We are only 4-6 girls in the class but the teachers are pretty dumb sometimes.Dont intend to be rude but thats just my view. One of the teachers said she learned about ""our problems"" but is clueless when we speak out about the things you should know when you learned about them sorry if i make no sense right now just typing my life story haha. So life is really messed up atm. I want to kill my bullies. I do have suicidal thoughts but not too extreme i think and not too often. But i would do it. I think about messed up things and also life idk if that makes sense but im thinking about how does love work? Do i want to be a boy or a girl? Do i want a boyfriend/Girlfriend? Or do i want to be alone forever. I trusted a girl in school AGAIN. Im trying my best to hold back when she talks behind my back but sometimes i just cant. I keep telling myself not to cry over a girl like this but then i remember my old friends. We had so many great memories and i thought we would go through life together i could cry my soul out.

"I made a promise not to do it, a while ago, but it's hard to keep it when I see no happiness ahead","I'm 21MtF (Trans woman)

For most people, at least in my experience, High School is miserable, but once they graduate they can start working towards the life they truly want

For me this is the other way around. High School was the life I truly wanted. Every single moment after graduation has been miserable and it doesn't look like it will get better

I have peaked in High School, I admit it. I promised I would not off myself a while ago, in 8th Grade, after I tried for the first and so far last time

But after High School, it just feels like nothing matters. I had everything I could have wished for in my High School years, everything improved the second 9th Grade started. I was popular, happy, people recognized my gender, everyone respected me, I had tons of friends, even a boyfriend, I was happy...

Everything went downhill, in a straight line, the second I graduated

I just no longer know where I'm heading, I never thought of life past school, I never WANTED to think of life past school, because school life was perfect

I don't have any ambitions, any goals, any desires, and ever since graduation even my transition feels useless

I don't know how to be a functional adult, I didn't want to be an adult in the first place. Being an adult genuinely sucks, and I hate it

And I know it's just life

But I had the perfect life, I had everything I could have wanted and more. Now I have nothing, no hope of returning to my former state unless I get dementia and my brain gets stuck on High School

No hope for the future, no hope for anything

I didn't consent to being born, I didn't consent to graduate either

I feel so lost

I am thinking that maybe this life was not meant to be lived

And I don't want to do it, I genuinely don't, because I made a promise

But I genuinely see nothing ahead to look forward to, only light I see is when looking backwards. A light that will never be recovered, it cannot be recovered, because as much as I want to be a teenager again, that's just not possible, so ending it now, feels almost like the only option

For most, the end of High School is the start of the journey. I feel like in my case, it is the end of it

And I deluded myself by telling myself that “it’s better she left when I was 8 than now, how would I cope with it as a conscious adult” 

Only lately have I started to piece it together and realise the fucking effect not having a maternal figure had on my entire life. I kept all the feelings in a box hidden in the back of my mind.

It is so fucking overwhelming realising the mistakes I made, the decisions I took and the things that I missed out on as a direct or indirect result of that. 

I was groomed by my grandfather in a sense that he would fiddle around with me. I was being subconsciously conditioned that it is okay for anyone to touch down there. My mom was the only person that knew I she died with it. To the point 7 year old me had my dick out and in the hands of my 4 year old sister. To the point where I ended up In situations I didn’t want to be in. To the point that I found myself bent over infront of another man - nothing could happen luckily, I still have my anal virginity for my current gf to take :). To the fucking point and I fucking hate to admit it that I was fucking into it?? I’m a hundred percent straight?? What the fuck? What the actual fuck. 

I’ve made mistakes because the feelings of utter shame, because I felt filthy and disgusting and unworthy to love, because I felt I didn’t deserve that happiness everyone had, because there was no one to fucking listen to me, for me to talk to and it was just so fucking lonely. These feelings kept broiling until I found myself inside someone you pay for. I was a fucking mess. My life was in ruins. I thought it would make it better, that maybe this is what I fucking deserve because of how disgusting and dirty my past has been. I thought it would make it go away. It didn’t become a habit but those feelings of disgust and shame became tenfold. Ended up doing upward or 12 Xanax’s a day to erase that part of my memory.

My 19th birthday, didn’t have a single someone to wish me and I got my dopamine from 4 strangers wishing me on here. 21st birthday? Slept through midnight and woke up to zero notifications. 

It is so scary being in this world with all these realisations, that only started to sprout, when I met the love of my life. When I started to “heal”. I had kept myself in denial. But I keep thinking I did all of that on my conscience. That I’m just connecting the wrong fucking dots. That I’m an inherently bad person. That I’m just making shit up. 

Because yes I won’t deny I did look at the opposite gender in a misogynistic, sexist way, have locker room talk and made disgusting comments about them. I did pass around all those remarks incels give say to women, to the point where I had developed a habit of looking at not porn but pictures of women? I’m not proud to admit this but I’ve been exactly that person.

But was it was just my subconscious hatred towards the other gender that was instilled by the fire I had in me that my mother left me alone? I hadn’t grown up around a morally straight crowd. Because I do remember when I was in middle school taking a shit and two guys and a girl broke the bathroom door open to look at me sitting there naked. I remember those same bunch of 13 year olds forcing me on a daily basis to show them my penis. I never gave in. Because I do remember being around the same teenage boys that would harass, catcall, or violate them in any other way, and I would know deep down that it’s wrong. Because I knew that imposing yourself on someone like that and doing something that is not out of their consent, is wrong - even if I had to be on the receiving end, and be an anomaly among the crowd to learn that lesson way earlier in life than anyone else. 

But then again should I kill myself for being in a room years ago where someone was actively getting raped and not saying anything? Just because I froze? Just because I saw myself in there, powerless and not being able to say anything? Because I caught my grand dad doing the same to my younger brother and knowing the lasting affects it will have on his life but not doing or saying anything because I froze again? I have things on my conscience that fucking eat me alive.

Please someone make some sense for me,
Am I a shameful person with a shameful life? Because every single time I look back at my life, I fucking hate the person I see. 

A friend just threw away a blade i looked at daily and had kept in my cupboard for the last month. Im not dumb to actually execute something like that, maybe because Im just a pussy, but sometimes I do feel like that’s the only way out.

I’m happy but just want it to end,"I’d say I’m as happy as I have ever been but I’m ready for it to end. Let me give you a little back story.

I grew up in very rough conditions, extreme poverty, drugs use, no parental figures available, fighting, physical and mental abuse, etc. But I decided at a young age I didn’t want to live like that and really focused in on school to try to beat the odds. I was able to go from “alternative learning” classes to advance classes, eventually graduating top of my class with high honors. Still living in poverty I skipped college and started working full time in a factory makes decent money.

In my mid 20s I realized what I wanted to do as a career and what I was extremely passionate for, so I went to school, graduated and landed my dream job! By this point I had made it out of the poverty level and actually bought a house. 

Currently (in my late 20s) I have a career that I love, a beautiful home, no debt, travel regularly, have had amazing relationships, have friends, and honestly have an amazing life, I’m just tired.

Im tired of it all. Everyday I wake up and fantasize about it all stopping. I don’t necessarily want to die, I just don’t want to exist. I haven’t ended it because I know the emotional toll it would cause the people around me. Im afraid if I end it people will think I was hiding my sadness but I’m really not sad.

Im not a religious person so I assume at the end everything stops. I wouldn’t expect to have a conscious or there to be a heaven. I find that most comforting. I think I’m simply tired of existing and I don’t know how to stop that feeling, or if I want to stop it. 

I would also go on a limb and say this might be dude to a hereditary gene or something bc my mother has attempted suicide multiple times and her father did do it. 

Not sure why exactly I posted this. Maybe just to get it off my chest? Who knows but maybe someone else can relate to this.",justanotherdustapot,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12d9ah3/im_happy_but_just_want_it_to_end/

I'm just afraid. Not of what comes after death, not even the act of dying itself. I'm afraid that it will hurt. The fear of physical pain is the biggest hurdle to overcome, and I need to know that I'm not alone in this thought. I just want someone to tell me that it won't hurt for long, that I'll pass out within minutes rather than hours, that the adrenaline rush will mask the pain in my arms and neck.

Giving up,"Hi everyone.

I have axial psoriatic arthritis, which I’ve learned means my prognosis is much worse than if it was just peripheral. 

I’ve had it for 17 months. 

I have almost no pain or symptoms, but I’m extremely mentally unwell though realizing what it means. 

I’m also dealing with something called sedative hypnotic kindling. Anytime I take anything that affects GABA receptors, I have horrible symptoms. 

Sadly I’ve learned TNF inhibitors may do this. Meaning I may not be able to take them for the rest of my life. 

Lidocaine and steroids are also off the table permanently . 

I feel like I have a future of nothing but constant never ending pain, and will use up every biologic that isn’t a TNFi very quickly, as TNFis seem to be the only class with lots, leaving me in 24/7 agony and torture with no way to stop it. 

I think about ending it constantly. I feel if I’m already feeling like this before the pain even starts, what’s the point, this is the best I’ll ever feel again, and I already can’t stand it.",Particular-Beat-6219,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12dd375/giving_up/

But why is it that I am feeling this urge and want to do it again, is it because I’ve found out that people I trust the most are just two faced, or that a literal rapist is going to be a type of boss next year where I’m at, or that said person and someone else who I thought were the holiest people, made me lose my faith. Or Maybe it’s because my last ex just used me as a pin cushion and a lap dog to make her feel better. Idk why I’m even typing this, nobody truly cares. In my case people only care bc I have something they want most of the time, and all the time those people never want to hang out or anything, they never invite me anywhere, or anything, and it seems like I all do for them is listen, but nobody ever does it for me, I try to help people and I try to be there for them.

My Strange Casual Attitude About Suicidal Ideation (M 26),"Lately, I have had suicide in the back of my mind even when my mood is even keel at the moment.  To give a brief summary of my issues, they result from loneliness, alienation, dissatisfaction with my current situation, feeling undesirable and a general disdain for myself which in turn makes it harder to be alone.  I HATE my own company. You know, typical shit that a large chunk of young men mull over these days.

But right now, I am in a pleasant mood just sipping my coffee and watching lets plays on YouTube.However, internal phrases like ""I do not want to live past 40 years old"" or ""if I just drink 12 bottles of sleep aid, I can go to sleep and never wake up"" and I ponder on how my self inflicted death would effect those around me.  All of this still rings throughout my head yet I have no emotional reaction to it.  Is it the Prozac finally kicking in?  Have I just gotten used to thinking this way?

I say all this to ask if any of you have experienced the same level of apathy towards this very dark dangerous thinking.",Chriscringal666,7,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12cmdtz/my_strange_casual_attitude_about_suicidal/
Sleep Problems = Suicidal Behavior,"I’m bipolar. Things at work for me have become increasingly difficult over the past few weeks. I was baited into a reaction that caused a fallout of constant subtle taunts and passive aggressive behavior. 

We’re too small to have HR and my therapist says there’s nothing substantial enough to report anyway. I get maybe 5 hours of sleep a night. 

My psychiatrist is trying everything he can , medication wise, to keep asleep but nothing is sticking.

Sometimes it feels too easy,"Just one leap over a balcony, sharp pain for a split second, then it all goes away. No more problems, no more thinking, no more worries, no more guilt. Just sweet nothing.

I didn't have this opportunity before, but soon I will.

Just fantasy for now, I keep thinking of the consequences post-mortem. I don't want to ruin the building's property value for the people who have clean me up. I guess that's the hard part then — doing it in a way that doesn't affect others. Not easy when you live in a city.

I just want this to be over. I haven't been happy without worry for years. Even when I feel happy, something comes up in my mind to ruin it all again. Even when I'm not thinking, that amorphous sense of worry haunts me and I don't even know the reason behind it.

I've tried so hard, I've tried to change my mindset, I'm going to therapy, I'm honest about everything, I take every bit of advice, nothing works.

I still think back to the time I let myself hang from a noose when I was 10. It hurts to know that I've always been like this. Existing only gets harder by the day.

Pets,"I have this kitten and they are literally triggering my mental health episodes so badly. They make me so upset that I get chest pains and I do have a heart condition. When I eat, there they are, harrassing me for food. I’ve tried nice discipline doesn’t work. I flunked out of my math class because any time I would try to study there they are, biting my hands as I write. Attacking and biting my feet. I am covered in scratches. Or they climb up my back using claws. I was seriously ill recently and it was quite a dangerous situation and I’ve still not recovered because the kitten does not let me rest. I’ve been sick for almost three months now. Pneumonia is no joke. I am allergic to the cat as well. It’s bedtime? Time to attack me and make as much noise as possible. I have shut the kitten in their own room but it’s making me spiral. I’ve had kittens my whole life due to my family being animal hoarders. I don’t have healthy relationships with animals because when you live in a house with 14 cats, pissing and shitting EVERYWHERE, cat food cans all over the counter, bowls all over the floor where you can’t walk, parent telling you a cat died and it’s in a garbage bag by the dumpster (and that’s the beginning and end of that convo), watching them beat the cats then swear up and down they love the cats, yeah, you don’t have a healthy relationship with cats. My kitten got her head stuck under the door the other day and idk how her neck didn’t get broken by my taking them out from under the door, it was that bad. It sent me flying into a panic attack and triggering my heart and blood pressure. I’m losing weight because I can’t eat since I’m harrassed by this animal. They don’t cuddle, they don’t act sweet, they just attack me if I make any sudden movement, use claws, and yes i play with them, they have toys, it’s triggering me to just end my life because I’m all they have and I feel like such a failure, I just left an abusive home and have my own place and this cat is just an absolute triggering nightmare.

I hate my life so much,"I hate my life so much

I feel so alone in everything I'm experiencing, and like any choice I can and will make is wrong.

Me and my partner have been long distance for four years, we are both disabled and struggle with suicidal thoughts and stayed alive for each other, but I can't take it anymore. My mental health issues are getting worse and so are his. I wish I could be done and leave but he'll die without me too, and his mother also says she will die without him, so I'd be responsible for potentially two deaths if not just one.

We've both made our promises and I feel like a piece of shit for thinking and feeling this way. His true self is so lovely and I never want to be with anyone else but I also can't endure the torture of our mental illnesses anymore.

Once a week he will tell me he wants to kill himself, harm himself by hitting his head as hard as he can until he passes out, beg me to just let him die, then he will beg me to never leave or else he will kill himself. He suffers greatly from many mental health issues such as extreme anxiety, paranoia (""don't eat that pear, it's probably poisoned! If you die I'll die!""), violent anger issues, agoraphobia and he refuses any and every type of professional treatment because he doesn't trust them or believe it will work. And when I've mentioned an ambulance or emergency services he's implied violence towards them when he spirals. He believes that I am the only one who can help him overcome his issues. I find this terrifying!

He expects me to immigrate to his country but was unable to file the paperwork due to his depression and anxieties so he wants me to move illegally because he says ""I'll die if I have to wait that long! I can't wait anymore! You have to come here now!"" And it scares me shitless! All the red flags pop up in my head telling me not to do this but I feel emotionally blackmailed into doing this and just want to die everyday. I procrastinate and waste away. All the beauty I feel within our dynamic is breaking as everything feels impossible and completely unreasonable. 

If this were all just a manipulation and he wasn't serious about killing himself I would've left long ago, but he is dead serious with a previous attempt as proof. I am heart broken and feel like a monster for not being able to do this anymore, even if I know that it's not my fault it will always *feel* that way and I will always feel that guilt if he dies because I can't fulfill our promise to be together. Breaking him completely, as I'm the only other person who he has trusted who hasn't betrayed him somehow.

I hate my situation and I hate how I got here. I hate myself and I just want it all to end. I guess I reap what I sow and I never should've tried to come out of my shell and talk to people again if this was the result. I was such a dumbass to ever think I could help anyone or to ever be healthy and well again. I'd be better off dead, but I'm such a coward. I hate that I'm such a stupid little coward for getting this deep and now it's too late.

I'm sorry if this is disjointed and all over the place but I needed to vent. Everything sucks and I don't know how to deal with it all. I'm sorry.",throwaway_meeps,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12dbf9f/i_hate_my_life_so_much/

Why do I always want to kill myself before my birthday?,"I'm not sure why, but the week or so in the run up to my birthday makes me want to end it all every single year. 

Nothing particularly traumatic has to happen, or has happened around this time of year in comparison to other times of the year. It should be ok for me.

I am doing everything to help myself- taking my meds on time, going out for walks, spending time with people I love. I just feel like an empty shell of myself as soon as I am alone and don't have to be strong for others going through worse and/or put on a front so people do not worry about me. 

I've moved away from what was a difficult situation, I've settled on the other side of the country, I'm looking for work, I have my degree and a wonderful relationship, I'm eating daily for once, I'm not alone all the time like pre-move (mid February), I go to therapy at least once every 10 days. 

I haven't attempted since April 2021. I'm now able to live in the community and have a two week supply of my own medication. 

Everything in theory is better and heading in a good direction. I've regained a lot of the things I lost (last attempt I donated almost everything I owned and ended friendships ahead of time so they'd have distance and time to make my death less impactful). 

I don't understand why I'm sat here exhausted, too tired to cry but I need to cry because not crying is giving me a headache. I haven't even had any flashbacks in the last few days. I still feel like hurting myself. I can't because I refuse to do that to the people I live with, and I refuse to put my partner through that (last time I had these thoughts this loudly I ended my relationship with a different person at that time, distanced myself from friends in a way that I have only just started to mend, and I do not want to lose everyone again. I also want to marry the person I am dating so I know that I won't leave them even if it gets bad, which makes me feel even guiltier because what if I do end up attempting again?)

I don't know. I don't want to hurt people but I do want to die just this evening. 

It's not like previous occasions where I have a date, a plan ready to go, I've tried up all my loose ends and written all my letters etc. 

I just have the feeling. I guess it is progress to have the feeling and not entirely tank my life again. 

I just want to be normal. It's probably my cPTSD. But I don't want to have a birthday. I don't even want to be alive right now so why the fuck should I have a birthday? 

I'm in a situation where I can't impulsively off myself before the day. So I am not in danger. I just need to put it out there somewhere that my birthday makes me want to kill myself every year. 

I don't know if that makes me some kind of selfish, developmentally stunted peice of shit. But if the shoe fits, I guess I'll wear it. 

I'm trying so hard. Why does it still hurt this much to be alive when I've done so much work? I did the work. I did that. Where did it go? Why can I just hear myself screaming in my chest but I can't get any words or tears to come out? 

Maybe it's PMS, maybe it's just absolutely nothing. I feel like a monster more than I feel like a human. 

Does anyone else get this way about their own birthday?",ReindeerFluid7508,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12d0sra/why_do_i_always_want_to_kill_myself_before_my/
How did I fucking get here AGAIN,"I'm drunk as shit and my mind is reeling because I realize, once again, Ive found myself in a fucking position of unrequited love. Why can't I just stop fucking seeking out relationships when I KNOW I'll be disappointed?? 

When we first met we agreed to just be fwb's but a lot of emphasis on the friends part, he said he wanted to be good friends but didn't want a relationship. It wasn't personal and I originally agreed with that but as fuckint usual with me, ive developed feelings, and he partially fucking knows I have. 

I'm just waiting for him to leave too so I can once again attempt to kill myself for attention like always and then start all over adain

I'm not expecting him to feel the same, I'm just fucking delusional but that doesn't really change much for me right now. At least as long as I can provide what he wants he'll hopefully stay but even that i doubt and ive talked to him kinda about this but I know doing that pushes him away, he doesn't want to deal with some chick who can't just fucking trust him or play the one fucking role she agreed to playing

I wish I didnt want human connection, Id do anyrhibf to just fucking not want to love anyone or be with anyone, all this has done for me is make me miserable, I have no one to talk to, no one to go to, nobody who gets where I'm at, nobody who fucking cares, I don't get why in fucking here right now",_Used_Syringes_,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12db8lz/how_did_i_fucking_get_here_again/
Honestly what’s the point.,"I mean to be honest with myself, I have no reason to live, yet no reason to die. Yet, the fact I have no reason to live, no one who romantically cares for me, no friends, a boring life, I’m a stoner, I’m routinely going felony speeds and I just cut myself for the first time after a nervous break down after swearing I’d never do it.

Like why would I live? Like I just can’t stop the thought from crossing my mind of why don’t I just go on my final drive. Just get up to speeds and stay in 6th gear on wide open throttle. Wait till I pass a cop and keep going till I run out of gas or my engine exploded, then get shot screaming I want to die and fade into existence as a statistic.

Not sure what to do anymore,"I’m honestly not sure why I’m even posting on here but it’s worth a shot I guess. I am 19 and think about ending my own life almost if not every day. I have made detailed plans to the point where I think I have given myself a concussion or worse from beating myself repeatedly.

I was diagnosed with autism when I was two and was considered a “gifted” child. As such, school was a complete breeze and I never learned how to study, have discipline, or really anything that a functional person needs to live. This was until college. I have now failed every single class in a semester for the second time in a row. I have never worked in my life so I am truly doomed to fail and repeat this cycle for my whole life unless I end it in the only way I know how. 

I can’t tell my single mom because I don’t want to add even more stress. Therapy doesn’t work and medications do very little. I just smile and act like everything is fine because I can’t do anything else. I feel like I am paralyzed in my own broken psyche. I don’t have any other reason to continue living other than “Mom would be sad.” I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to fix anything. I don’t know much of anything at all.

My demons,"Looking back, my life has been nothing but failures. I always tend to keep fucking up everything. I really wish that my head wasn’t so fucked up in this way. I keep lying to my closest ones and tell them this the last time, and then when I’m alone in my room and locked the door I’m at my habit again and hurts everyone around me. My life is an ongoing spiral that keeps going down and my soul is getting lost in the oblivion permanently. 

I stay quiet and look natural, but my soul is screaming from the abyss. I want to live and laugh, I want to die and stop existing. Everything feels so peaceful when the sunlight is out, but when the night comes it’s when all the demons comes to alive. They waiting for me in the shadows and when I’m alone they surrender me with scream that echo everywhere.  

This fight has been ongoing for years and I can’t resist the forbidden desires these demons put in my heart. But I’m about to lose myself and the grip of reality.

Can't talk about wanting to die anywhere else so here I am! Hi!,"I originally followed through with the impulse to start writing a post with the intention of doing some trauma-dumping, talking about how I've been homeless a few times and how scared I am that it'll be chronic, talking about being estranged from my family because being around my father is the equivalent of self-harm because he's *just that bad.* I thought about writing a few paragraphs of how fucking sad and angry and upset and carved-out I feel trying to maintain literally any semblance of mental wellbeing under late-stage capitalism. I'm poor. I don't have a family to help me out with shit because that's what abuse took from me.

Here's my main thing, though. I'm fucking tired. I'm so tired I want to die? I'm so tired I want to die. I am almost thirty and I am so tired I want to die. I watched my mom die when I was 20. I just... look. I just want a place to live, somewhere I won't be chased out of due to rent rising every fucking year. I want a support network. I want to make art, that's all I wanna do. I want to be able to live and eat without selling all of my fucking time to jobs that become new sources of chronic pain I don't have the money to treat, but there isn't another option. *There isn't another option for me*. Either I stick it out, or I follow through on one of the many, many plans I've dreamed up over the last few decades.

The terrifying, awful thing to me is that so much of this? So much of it is luck. When you don't have assets, it's luck that pushes you in one direction or the other, and the fewer assets you have the less of a buffer there is when it comes to the ripple effects of Bad Things Happening.

I don't have the resources, or the capital, or the assets, and I've had a few years of bad luck. I got real unlucky with my family and it snowballed from there. I know that now. I'm done being in denial about the harm done. And so much of happiness is dependent on luck. I know that now, I've seen it. I lived in a homeless shelter recently. Fuck, it's so hard. How long do I have to hold out for? I'm tired, when do I get to stop?

"If I lose my cat, I am going to take my own life.","*Trigger Warning (SA)* 
I live with my mentally ill mother who loves to move around a lot because she thinks people are following her. Long story short—she hasn’t been paying utilities for our apartment and today they gave her the rent back and said they couldn’t accept it because we were getting evicted. They are trying to say it’s rent because it’s so obvious they are scamming us with a fake utility statements but we can’t afford legal aid. We just moved to California from nice, affordable Arizona and now we might be homeless for the umpteenth time. My cat is all I have. My brother too, but I know I won’t lose him. She is my everything.

The first time I was homeless was when I was 12 and when we moved into this homeless shelter I was sa’d by four different boys, two of whom were brothers and lived in the shelter.

Everything else is in shambles. I’ve just fully withdrawn myself from everything and it kinda scares me how much I don’t care. I don’t know how I’m supposed to keep going. The beams in my dorm are looking really tempting. I don’t have a roommate. My family lives 16 hours away. It’d be so easy to just do it. I can end this pain. I’ve been so numb and just going through the motions. But no matter how many times I start to, I can never go through with it. I hate myself for being such a coward. 

I’m stuck in my situation and I can’t escape. I feel like such a burden on my parents. College is so expensive and my medical care is so expensive. Everything is so expensive and my parents are sinking themselves into so much debt for my education and I hate it. And they’re gonna be in more debt when my sister starts college in a year. I hate it so much. I hate that I’m so helpless and I can’t do anything to help them. I wish I could just work so I can atleast pay for my daily expenses but I legally can’t because of my visa status. I hate the government. My parents have done everything legally and paid taxes in this country for the past decade but its so unfair that we can’t get federal aid or loans. I’m always so stressed about finances because I see how stressed my parents are. My heart just breaks for them. It would be so much easier for them and my sister if I just took myself out of the equation. I think the only reason I haven’t done it is because I want to take care of my parents and give them a good retirement. It’s the least they deserve for all the hardships that they’ve gone through. 

I’m just so so exhausted with having to keep a happy facade up and to pretend that I’m not falling apart on the inside. I try distracting myself with school and social life but it’s hanging over me like a dark cloud. And it rears it’s stupid, ugly head every moment that I’m not occupied with something. I barely have any energy for my friends anymore. But I don’t want to burden them at my issues. I’m angry at myself for neglecting my other commitments that are not school like my sorority and research. I’m so numb. Food doesn’t taste like anything anymore. Things I used to enjoy is all just noise and I’m apathetic to it all. The world is shades of grey. The apathy is new. I’ve had bad episodes before but I’ve never been numb like this. I just can’t do it anymore. I can feel myself drowning and I’ve fought for so so long but I’m getting tired. I’m barely hanging on.

I think this is it,"You know, I feel like I've been flirting with death for years, but now it's my choice and it's kind of liberating. It's a funny feeling. And it's great because I don't care. Like, really, I feel ok and sort of at peace that I don't need to worry, because what's there to worry about when you're gone? The only thing I really worried about was the family dog, and she'll be fine. I do hate the idea of her not knowing why I'm gone, and her being sad, but she'll be ok. My parents will be ok. Sad, but ok. In the end none of it really matters! And that's the funniest thing! Shit happens! People die all the time! And life just goes on. That's it. Wow, I feel so ok with this, and I've accepted death before but it's almost like embracing that this is what I want gives it so much more...clarity? Maybe. Oh and I'm doing all the prep and it's, relieving. Final notes, last will, making sure everything is arranged. Talk about having affairs in order. I only hope it's honored. I've joked with my parents to not have any kind of typical religious funeral service, but now I'll have that in writing, and if they don't honor that ho boy am I going to give them shit from the other side. I don't really believe in anything like that, and my best hope is that I'll simply return to the source, energy. Not God, not heaven, but simply a different way of experiencing our universe. It's like going home. I told my therapist how I felt and she said I sounded like a 97 year old who was basically at the end of life. I'm 32 for reference. I feel like I've seen enough. I've seen the good, the bad. I don't have any faith in humanity anymore and I just don't want to be here. I want out. If an alien species was an option I'd nope right off this rock and see what it's like out there. But that isn't an option, so I'm left with just taking myself out of the equation. Biggest issue method. I've abhorred the idea of putting a hole in me, I don't want anyone seeing me like that. And the noise and mess. No. Blades are ok, but still messy. My preferred method is just fading out. Taking an overdose of something and just drifting off. I have some things but nothing I think would outright do the job 100%. How hard is it to get fenty? Or cyanide? I've never been into drugs and I guess that's what sucks about living that lifestyle. I guess I could've had more fun. Anyway, I'm sure I can find some. But anyway thanks for listening, I'm not sure when it'll happen, maybe tonight, maybe the weekend. We'll see!

There really is nothing,"I always thought there would be *something* that I could do if things got rough. Government assistance, food pantry, SOMETHING! But there's NOTHING where I live. My stupid fucking country and my stupid fucking state are both determined to help the poor and the destitute as little as fucking possible. I've been near starvation for the past several weeks. Tomorrow will be my third consecutive day without eating, *again!*

My case worker has tried to do all he can but at some point, even he lamented that there was only so much he could do. He mentioned wishing that he could do more for his clients. My food pantry is only open 2 days a week and are open from 1-3 and it's first come fist serve. Of course, I can't drive there anyway since my car is on E! Someone in my life suggested that it might be time to start panhandling

I knew the world was cruel to the poor but I didn't think it was *this cruel and uncaring.* Right now, all I want to do is curl up and die. I'm seriously considering hanging myself.

I drown myself in work to take my mind off things but even that’s going downhill,"I just need to vent. Have no friends (haven’t for years). No S/O, never had a relationship. Still living with parents in my late 20s (they’re pretty toxic and always fight but I think making them sad is the reason I haven’t ended my life).

Stuck in this dead end job, that is it’s low paying but I like what I do. And working keeps my mind off things. But lately people have been ruining it for me. All the old crew that started with me are gone and most this new team is so lazy/incompetent 

My old boss was so nice and always thanked me and even promoted me to a senior tech. But then she retired and this new boss feels like she has it out for me, she shows blatant favoritism and doesn’t care for my input. 

I come to her with personal and work related issues and she doesn’t do anything and basically wants me to figure things out or blames me. She thanks other coworkers but not me . And it’s been this way for at least a year 

Today I was following procedure and telling her something keeps alarming cause the sop says “alert management” and she gave me attitude “I know already”…her tone was not how you should be talking to a colleague 

I think she keeps me around cause she knows I do work so the others can have time to kick their feet up …sure I like that the work keeps me occupied but that’s not fair they get paid more at night to do less

Everyone else likes her but they’re the same people who leave work for the next shift when they have time to do it or keeps screwing up the same thing. She just had a baby, I hope when her kid grows up they have a better boss than I do.

Oh I brought up how this one coworker keeps messing the same task up expecting her to offer training or talk to him. **Get this, she told me I should be nice cause she thinks he may have depression and suicidal thoughts…meanwhile I’m secretly sitting across from her with those same thoughts 😂 but no one cares or notices when it’s me**

I’m trying to save enough money for back to school and moving out but that’ll be years at this rate 

It’s a niche line of work but I like it, would be hard to find a similar company close to home. Most employers would love a slave that just cares about the work and tries to get everything done but not this one. Work was the one thing I had to keep myself occupied but now it’s causing more stress in my life, been going home crying lately cause it feels like nothing will change",Dextexer,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12d3hv3/i_drown_myself_in_work_to_take_my_mind_off_things/
Can someone help me navigate this situation I am hopeless,"This is a complex situation but I am going to try and summarize it as best as I can because I could really use some guidance.

In High school, I was really involved in student government and had a prominent leadership position. Student government was my life. I loved the organization and the community and my closest friends were from there. I don't think I would have made it out of high school alive without it.

During my senior year, I struggled really badly emotionally because i had a lot of traumatic stuff with my parents take place. My counselor and I worked out that I could stay only for the student government period and take college classes instead of my high school ones. This was an agreement we made together that 100% allowed.

This February, my student government teacher who *i thought* I was close with pulled me aside and told me I need to drop the ASB class because students were coming up to him telling him that they don't understand my situation. I asked him why they don't just come to me personally to ask and he said that they don't know how. This obviously broke my heart but I respected my teacher's request and unenrolled completely from high school and went to community college because it was my only option.

This is where I need advice. I loved this group more than anything and it was my life. Because my teacher asked me to leave, I am spiraling. Nobody from that class has reached out to me since I left. I didn't even get a goodbye, AT ALL. Nobody knew it was my last day, I spent the whole period outside talking with my teacher. I feel like a horrible person who nobody cares about and I don't see a point in living anymore. I am suicidal and I feel like I would be doing a favor to humanity by killing myself because of how useless I am. I know these thoughts are irrational but I can't snap out of them. I can't get a therapist because my insurance has a 4-5 month waitlist. I am prescribed medicine and it helps but it feels like just a bandaid for this really intense hopelessness I am experiencing.

I am trying to practice stoicism by working hard in my college classes and college application, but investing in my future feels stupid because I don't think I'm even deserving of success. I have done shrooms a few times to get perspective and they have helped but ultimately my main issues is this lack of human connection and fulfillment I have. I know my thoughts aren't consistent with reality but because no one has reached out and I'm completely cut off I don't know what else to think.

I am confused and scared.,"For some context, I am a 17M and in my second to last year of High School. I also noticed that this post seems much less serious or extreme than the rest of the posts here, so there's that.

&amp;#x200B;

I very often find myself thinking about suicide, and have even attempted it. The weird thing is, some days I find myself in this abyss where I can't bring myself to even do anything productive, and all I can think about is how nothing matters and how I plan to kms, but others I feel the complete opposite and have a very positive outlook to the future. I don't know when I'm going to take the plunge, but these off days of extreme suicidal thoughts are getting more frequent, extreme, and extensive. it's getting hard to do schoolwork a lot of times in school because all I can think about is how none of it matters and how pointless it is anyway, and I skip school for days at a time doing nothing but laying in my bed and contemplating it all. The bright side is that when I'm not feeling like this, I'm much more productive and ready to exist and do things, but the days where I feel terrible are now more often than when I 180, and I feel I am coming very close to the point of no return, whether it be kms or ruining my future because of how lazy I am. I've told my closest friend about my suicidal thoughts and he's told me to seek help many times, and I've finally decided to do so, since today I'm in my positive headspace. The reason I'm emphasizing the fact that it's like 2 completely different mindsets is because my mom has a lot of mental health issues, such as DID, severe depression, and anxiety, which a lot of she inherited from her parents, and it almost feels like I'm a different person when I'm in one of my positive moods compared to my negative ones, so I think it may be associated with that. Is this normal for depression? Am I just stupid and lazy, and none of this is real at all? Please, help me find a way to get myself out of this pit I feel I'm in, before I fall all the way down. And really, I don't feel as if I've suffered an ungodly amount or like my life has been horrible, but I can't help myself from entering these stupors and feeling these feelings.

I want to begin a plan to live my life to the fullest for about 5 years doing what I want when I want without needing to worry about growing old and getting sick and dying with wasted money in the bank. Am I wrong?,"I believe I'm justified in all my views I'm about to express below, but at the same time I acknowledge that my brain and my thought process about this might just be deeply flawed , so please question me if you need to or offer any perspectives that you feel are appropriate.

I have had and provided support to friends who have wanted to end their life for reasons related to money or relationships or not seeing a way forward in life, Etc and if someone wanted to end their life for these reasons I would always try and help them to see that things will get better, there's usually people around who can help you. But these aren't the reasons why I want to end my life.

I believe people should have a right to end their life whenever they want. I don't want to end my life because I'm sad or something about my life is failing to live up to expectations. I just want to keep control over it and live it on my terms and end it on my terms when I want. My thoughts about ending my life have honestly nothing to do with being sad or empty. If anything I view it as a positive thing and over the last five or so years I have been increasingly viewing it like this.

Context - I am male, 32, full-time employed in a decent job which earns me and above average salary. I'm from a western Nation but currently living abroad working in a field I love. I have friends and a girlfriend, family. I enjoy my life and outside of work fill my time with activities I love. I have enough cash in the bank that if I stopped working I could live in my quite expensive to live in home country doing what I want reasonably well for probably 4 or 5 years. Could drag it out far longer or significantly improve my quality of life if I stuck to cheaper countries where my dollars stretch further.

I've never been okay with the idea of growing old and sick. I've watched older relatives in my own family or family friends Health failing as they get older and this truly terrifies me. All the things I enjoy doing I know that I will much more enjoy doing while I am young and fit and healthy. Part of my brain wonders about the possibility of starting a family and doing all those things based about the long-term building of a life, but the more I think about it it doesn't just not appeal to me but it feels awfully restrictive and just not suited to how I want to live my life. If others want that, then that is great for them and I'm so happy for them, but I honestly don't think it's for me.

In my early twenties I was married for about 5 years. In the end my wife cheated and we broke up. If anything it was probably the best lesson I've ever received as that marriage taught me that a long-term stability life building with kids and a house and a retirement plan just simply doesn't appeal to me.

My thoughts have been considerably shaped by a friend of mine, about 5 years older than me, who has a similar plan.
He was one of the sons of an extremely rich Hong Kong Finance family. He hated everything they stood for and how they treated others and viewed the world, so he walked away from their family and hasn't been in contact with them for over a decade. They even tried to offer him literally tens of millions of dollars as a stake in the family business if he came back and joined the corporation, but he turned it down. He moved to the West, earned himself a degree, and got a job in a field he loves where he earns decent money and which affords him an awful lot of time off which allows him to explore his passions. I've had many conversations with him where he's told me how he simply does not want to grow old as he does not want to not be able to do the things he enjoys doing, and that family life does not appeal to him at all. So he intentionally spends all his money traveling and exploring and experiencing and when he gets to a point where he feels that's some of the doors in terms of his ability to do things and his ability to meet and relate to people and do the things he enjoys with them begin to close, he thinks probably around 40 to 47 years old, he will stop work and begin a several year long adventure to burn down his assets to zero before ending his life on his own terms.

I want to do what I want to do now, while I am young and fit and able surrounded by people with similar interests and passions to me. I'm a relatively Frugal person who is good at saving money, so I know that I am going to one day reach retirement with a considerable amount of money in the bank but probably not be able to use it based on the health of literally everyone older than me in my family. The idea of being old and tied to things in this world like family and children who I am not able to let down and have responsibility to and not be able to enjoy my money honestly terrifies me.

Obvious reasons so far I have not really discussed this with anyone in my family or my friendship circles except for mentioning a few things as throwaway comments which they haven't taken seriously. I really want to hear other people's thoughts on this as honestly the more I think it through the more it makes complete and total sent to me.
Just to be clear, I am in no way in validating the experience or the desires of people who want to build a long-term life and establish long-term goals like family or career or build for their retirement. My perspective is just those things don't really appeal to me and if I'm going to die at some point anyway which is inevitable, I would much rather do it in let's say 5 or 6 or 7 years after living a great life where I'm able to do what I want and spend what I want without worrying about being responsible for the future, instead of dying when I'm in my 70s or 80s or 90s in pain, while sick, lying in a hospital bed, with wasted cash in the bank that I worked my ass off for but was never able to enjoy.

Having chronic suicidal thoughts," 

Suicidal thoughts are weird for me, because it’s almost like a daily occurrence. 

It seems like the smallest inconveniences or large stressing issues can trigger them, sometimes up to 5 or 7 times a day. Although on average they stick to maybe once or twice a day.

Looking back I think I’ve been this way since I was 14 years old. I’m currently 19

I never really have intention to go through with them, or make a plan. They are kinda like escapist fantasies, in which I can just go away from the world. 

I don’t even want to tell anybody about this because I think being passively suicidal is still greatly misunderstood. 

I also just don’t want to scare people, since the big S word is something that automatically gets that knee jerk reaction. Especially with someone as jittery as Mom. Further more how is it even possible for someone who’s never dealt with mental illness to grasp passive suicidal thinking. 

The act of killing one’s self is just so opposite to most people’s line of thinking, and I guess even on a biological  level. So it’s probably really hard to understand why one would willingly entertain suicidal thoughts on a daily basis.

Most kid’s escapist fantasy is usually something like being a knight, a Jedi, a pirate or going to Hogwarts. 

When I was a kid I fantasized about being hit by a car and then coming back as a ghost to haunt the school. 

Maybe that’s just the weird kid in me, but I also think it was some kind of fucked up coping mechanism. 

I mean I did really like the Haunted Mansion growing up, and the concept of heaven and an afterlife was foundational to Catholic school upbringing. So maybe the concept of the permanent state of death just didn’t occur to me. 

Like maybe the thought rational as a kid was, “well I’m already guaranteed a spot in heaven so I can just call it quits now if I really wanted to.” Or maybe if I’m lucky I can come back to haunt the kids who teased me. etc. 

Being the weird kid in school didn’t help a lot. And to a certain extent I think I still hate myself for things I did all the way back in 3rd and 4th Grade. Even though I know logically that’s ridiculous, on a deeper level I haven’t really shook that self loathing. 

There are times, especially more recently, when I’ve legitimately considered going through with it. In a world where I’ll probably never be accepted and climate change really fucking us over within my life time, I’ve lost hours and even whole days wondering if living really is worth it sometimes. 

What ultimately stops me is that I know that I would condemn my loved ones to unimaginable pain. 

But, just for the sake of playing Devil’s advocate, what really is selfish in this situation? 

Subjecting my friends and family to that, or prolonging my own suffering and mental anguish just so that others can have peace of mind. 

Perhaps that’s not a healthy way of framing things though. I care about other people more than myself most times, so every-time I really sit and think about the options I always back away from suicide. 

I think that’s why I found self harm, specifically cutting, to be so addicting. It gave me that sense of hurting myself so I can pretend to die. And then in an hour or 30 minutes I can be back to normal. 

As of now suicidal thoughts usually work like, something goes wrong. Oh I can just kill myself to solve it. No-biggie. 

Like I just recently got news that I failed a Final. Now of course I’d be bummed out by that. So then my brain just brings up “Huh, I guess there really isn’t any hope in this life, time to see what jumping off that building will be like.” 

Or when I see bad news like Lgbt discrimination, or more recently Climate Change. 

And then I think,

“Wow I guess there really isn’t a reason for staying alive if humans are so shitty. Wonder if I can kill myself to just avoid the inevitable dystopian hellscape the world will be in.” 

I’ve thought of shooting myself, hanging, jumping, overdosing. 

And then in an hour or two it just fades and I go back to my daily routine. 

And on a logical level I am always able to counter it with a reasonable and rational argument. But it doesn’t always shake that lingering, low hopelessness that can come with passive ideation. 

What is most concerning to me is that the frequencies and intensity of my suicidal thoughts have increased noticeably within the past year. And it seems like the smallest inconveniences sometimes can trigger it. 

I worry that once day, say while driving, I’ll end up making that impulsive choice and veer my car off a cliff. 

I really think this has to do with the effects of the pandemic on my life, and my recent bad habit of doom scrolling. Which turns out to be a lot harder to break than I first thought. 

On a day when a combination of exposure to horrible things on the news, something goes wrong, reminders of climate change and alarmism, stress from classes or financial things, and heteronormativity being shoved in my face. That’s when I spiral. 

I’m usually able to handle those things one at a time fine. But put all together, it really weighs on me. That’s when it becomes difficult to work, do activities or even eat.",IntelligentView341,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12d7twg/having_chronic_suicidal_thoughts/
I can't take it. I can't live with myself.,"Been fighting all sorts of OCD for 8+ years now. Been addicted to porn for 8+ years now. Been suicidal the entire way through, but felt I could never commit suicide because I was too scared or I'd think about the affect I'd have on my loved one's lives. The fear of permanently ruining a part of someone's life. My mother suddenly bursted into tears last year or so when I told her how badly I wanted to die. Seeing her cry I never wanted to see it again and thought I couldn't do it if just me talking about it had that affect on her, but through the years I've slowly been becoming more willing to go through with it.

 I've been messing up and doing things/giving into compulsions that completely go against my morals and recently fucked up to the point I feel I can't live with myself and now feel there is no coming back for me. Even if everyone is saying what I think of myself isn't true, that I haven't hurt anyone, I'm still redeemable. It doesn't matter because I can't live with my own self. I want to die so badly. Or maybe I just want it to end, idk.

I've dealt with this exact feeling around 2 years ago. Same situation, I messed up and did something I viewed as irredeemable and ended up so fucked that I couldn't eat and couldn't sleep in the dark. I don't know how I got past that then. I got antidepressants and something I was told to take if I felt I couldn't trust myself anymore and wanted to kill myself but stopped taking both because of side effects.

Now I'm back in the same situation but without a crutch. I'm scared if I get out of bed I'll grab my kitchen knife and go through with it. I don't know what to do. Do I admit myself to a psychiatric hospital? I've heard of the things that could happen there and it's probably not going to do anything but make me feel worse. If I choose to live how am I supposed to continue to act like everything is okay when I see myself as irredeemable and can't accept it.

I’m so scared about something and afraid I’m going to get in trouble for this misunderstanding =[,"Hello, let me tell you the story because I don’t know maybe I’m overthinking this but Im too terrified right now and shaking very bad 

I scheduled a medical transportation ride to a plasma donation clinic that is in another town it’s 50 miles from me. When I got dropped off I looked and saw a lot of people inside and with my social anxiety I didn’t feel comfortable going in at all. I then decided just to walk around because the anxiety was too much to go inside. I’m scared and terrified now that I’m going get in trouble for this =[[[[

The reason I feel this way is if medicaid calls the plasma donation clinic to verify I was there and had a appointment and the plasma clinic says no that what’s makes me feel the way I do =[

The transportation asks you your appointment time when you set up the ride and I put close to around when the plasma clinic opened because I was going inside when I got there. Since I didn’t have a scheduled formal appointment with the plasma clinic I feel this is going hurt me =[[[[

All I wanted to do is get out of the home and do something good for a good cause but the anxiety got the best of me when I saw a lot of people. I didn’t care if I made money or not from the donation because money wasn’t my intention at all. but now I’m shaking and terrified I’m going to get in trouble for this =[[[[

I don’t know if it’s coincidence or not but I been getting calls from medicaid transportation. They don’t leave any messages. When I called them to ask them about because I’m concerned they keep saying that the calls were for just confirming my future ride appointment to the plasma clinic again. I don’t know it just seems off to me I never got any calls before confirming my other rides before that I recalled.

I did have a future ride again to the clinic but I canceled it because I don’t want to take any chances. I got on a another call with a different employee to assure me again because im still not calmed down but he said there’s no notes on my account. Then I get another call from medicaid transportation like an hour later. No voicemail again. I called again to ask them in they said that cancelling the appointment you get a phone call confirming the cancellation of the appointment. To me again that feels off and wierd because I canceled other appointments before due to rescheduling appointments and I never got calls about confirming my appointment cancellation that I ever recalled 

If something comes from this I don’t mind at all being billed for this trip I would pay it but you don’t know the employee your dealing with and they can escalate to further action

i have been really depressed since 6th grade, i even went to therapy but only like 4 times cuz my parents thought it wasnt helping me... well i couldnt even really tell my therapist how i feel because my parents were sitting right next to me so i just always said ""im fine"".

i never had close friends because i was ""weird"" and ""too quiet"" so nobody wanted to be seen being friends with me. i thought i had some best friends but they were just using me for BARELY some money i had on me, and they made fun of me behind me back, talked bad about me, manipulated me into thinking ive done and said something bad even though I KNOW i didnt do that. i was also badly bullied and no teachers wanted to help, they just told me to shut up and ""ignore them"", and my ""bestie"" ended up bullying me too. and me being ugly was rlly not helping.....

honestly, ever since i stepped into high school, i have changed, but im still kinda the same, just putting a fake personality so people actually think that im confident and independed. but even if i am confident, people call me ""arrogant"" and ""full of myself"", i rlly dont know what to do anymore.

i do have friends now, but i think that they dont rlly like me, i feel like a burden to them and i just think its best for me to leave everyone. i cant do it anymore. i really cant. ive been fighting for so long and i still feel the same. im planning on killing myself because i dont know any other way... and i know that nobody will actually be sad about me being gone, they will probably still make fun of me after my death, it never stops.

My recent suicide moods,"

can’t find the energy to leave bed for most of the day, sleep in until 1 pm and still feel tired, can’t fall asleep at night, oh god this is how my weekends are just so o can make it to work for the week, just weariness of the daily grind sapping the joy out of everything until it’s all grey static 


let’s just lie down in the forrest and become mushroom food kind of existential dread. life is pointless and I am but a tiny speck in the universe so it doesn’t really matter in the grand scheme of things if I die. 


the dangerous mood, where you’re energetic but very suicidal. the reason antidepressants can cause suicide. Suddenly you’ve got energy to actual go through with those plans! How very risky.

I'm gonna kill myself,"I don't want to be cringey or ""that person"" but I seriously can't deal with it anymore, my mom is driving me insane and I mean literally. I don't get any sleep, I get probably get two hours of sleep a night. My mom hates me, I hate her, we don't have a relationship. She does drugs and is an alcoholic with anger issues. We regularly fight everyday, but it's gotten worse. Every conversation we have is fighting and all she does is try to control me. She doesn't let me sleep, when she's loud and I ask her to be quiet she purposely gets louder after saying ""I'll be quiet"". She'll blast music and invite all her friends to the house to party. I can't move out because I have nowhere to go, I can't do anything with my life right now. I have no other option than to stay put and go through it. I've been depressed and cut myself in the past, I've never tried suicide though. I don't know if it's the sleep deprivation or if I'm really thinking it. I've been getting woken up 2-4 times a night. I'm uncomfortable in my own home. I've put a knife under my mattress and have multiple razors around my room. The only thing keeping me from killing myself is my cat. He he nowhere to go after I die. My mim hates me and is allergic, she wouldn't take care of him. She's drunk right now doing exactly what I mentioned earlier. Last month she did the same, waking me up, being loud, etc. She hit me last month and called me a bitch for accidentally slamming my door. I can't do it anymore. I'm tired of it. I knew I'd kill myself eventually because I can't see myself in the future. I can't imagine any version of me older than I am right now. I don't wish my cat and I would die, I want to leave this place with him but I can't. I wish I could trust someone with him when I'm gone but there's no one to trust.

What is the next move in my life (vent post i think),"Hi, My name is Sae, I'm 15 years old and have considered a violent suicide on more than one occasion. I don't mean to get personal but my friends told me reddit was a good message-board akin to Quora. Mentally, i don't feel 15. I've been on the internet since i was 10. I've been on every kind of message-board and chat log, i've seen every kind of gore video and been exposed to a lot of lascivious men on Omegle. My parents assumed i was smart enough to stay out of trouble on the internet but smart and wise aren't the same thing. I'm now being faced with the challenge of being a normal girl. Not normal but at least socially functional and not inept, google has led me to pages about the milestones i should be reaching at my age and ive exceeded in all of them expect the social kind. To me this isn't a good thing, ive never felt love or any kind of spiritual awakening in my short life. I cant believe in A God that enables me to feel these urges. My mother has told me on multiple occasions that being suicidal is a white person thing (sorry) and i need to just go outside. I imagine all the ways i can fuck up peoples lives by killing myself and disrupting their peace, just while typing this i don't feel in my body. Then i don't kill myself for the reason that i'm just giving everyone the ""benefit of the doubt"". But even then the people in my life wouldn't remember me past 3 months at best. I've thought about buying fentanyl laced carts/edibles and just sucking the life out of them and plugging my exhaust pipe with gauze. Or blurting out something horrible and shooting myself in the face after. I'm selfish but i don't think anyone would ever think i think these things.  I cant admit any of these things to a therapist in real life because when i told my first therapist i was sexually abused she dismissed me and tried to get me to play checkers with her.   I don't trust many people. My family included. I feel like i've grown too big for my childish mind.

Stark realisation,"Hi all, 

I'm not currently at risk but struggling a lot. 

I have been clinically depressed my entire life, and also just have dysthymia - happy feelings do exist but they're stand outs and fleeting. 

When I was 13, I didn't think I'd make it to 18. 

Now I've realised, there is no time frame.. but my life will end via suicide and it is scary. Not a matter of if, but when. There seems to be no other option. I'm exhausted and tired of living. I used to want to live to 70yrs old max.. but now even that feels like forever, the goal has dropped to 50. I couldn't imagine living past then I am tired now. Without suicide, I'd live too long anyway. 

At this point I'm plodding along just existing seeing how much longer I can go on.. but I'm exhausting. I see no point in long term goals, and know consequences of stuff I might do but don't care anymore. 

This isn't a ""help me"" post cause I've accepted this but wanted to get it out.

I can make it convenient at least.,"I just got the address to my local coroner. I've also figured out how to schedule texts. Now trying to decide what to do before it gets dark. But I hope that makes it bit easier. I hope that'll make the process easier. Boot straps straps only last about a year ya know. So if you see someone you care about only lasting at job by their bootstraps. That's a sign.. I think I'll get a box of those Lindor assorted chocolates. Oh and I can get sushi too. I just I wasn't so hard to be around or that my family just let go on disability when I was 18 or even now. But I'm 25 and they were able to force me into working for 6 years, so cleary my depression isn't that bad. Honestly I love working it's fun to feel useful ya know. People don't realize how important social skills are. You need them for everything, if you're social skills are inadequate.. You're basically worthless, because everyone only sees you flaws.. Without being able to play the social game, everybody just thinks you're up to something. I should be angry... I should be blowing up everyone that pushed further in. But I like you know.. They're just people. I'm person too. They're the  same as me. I just grew up blind, I've got sensory processing issues, add, dyslexia, and that wasn't easy for anyone around me so especially because I'm really smart... Yeah so now I've ptsd and a lot of untreated concussions. My mom's been trying to help in anyway she can think of. But nobody gets that I just can't function the way everybody else. Especially since I'm terrified of other people. I feel like should clean my room so nobody has to deal with the mess. Or call someone that can get the support I need. But it'll just be pointless.. It's all just a manipulative stunt for attention because you never know until it's to late. I just don't want my family to have to go to my funeral. I still remember my sister's she was 15 and passed during a seizure when I was 7. I was honestly relieved that she didn't have to suffer anymore. I was jealous too.... But when I got up to speak at her funeral everyone was so sad and crying. So I forced myself to cry because if said how I felt it would've hurt everyone for a different reason. I always felt like a monster for not being sad. But now I realize I was already so far gone at that point. Ya know in high school I would spend hours on kik. I was admin for a lot of rooms. During that time I talked 25 people down. But a little advice, if someone asks you to have a video call... just accept their last said response. Some people just want someone to be there with them. I'd honestly be fine if I wasn't forced to be around other people, not because I don't like them. I like being around other people. I just can't socialize and that makes others mad and resentful.",Lonely_Ad7498,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12d4i33/i_can_make_it_convenient_at_least/
debating sending this suicide note,going back and forth on it. im ready to check out but don't know if i should send this note,edw1224,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12d47eg/debating_sending_this_suicide_note/
im so scared and confused and idk what to do anymore,"ive been sat crying for the past few hour, dealing with some of the worst thoughts ive ever experienced. ive been actively planning out a way for me to just disappear. ive had thoughts of a similar strain before, but its never been this bad.  
ive tried seeking counselling for this before, i was put on medication, which worked for a bit, but i cant afford to keep buying new pills every month, let alone food, rent and bills. talking about this with people just never works for me, i hate having uncomfortable reactions with another person, so to spew out how im feeling to a person over the phone, or in person, makes me feel a million times worse.  
i feel like im letting everyone down, but i dont talk to anyone bar my two housemates anymore, but even that feels scarce at most, so i dont know whats troubling me. half the time, the way they respond makes me feel like they dont actively give a shit, theyre always talking about how they put on a fake persona in front of mutual people we dont like, and im always worrying that theyre doing the same to me.  
i dont talk to my parents at all anymore after i moved to uni. i never had the best relationship with either of them (one less so than the other) but i well and truly regret it. during my first year, i saw all these people constantly calling their parents, having cute interactions with them, and the most i get around to doing is asking them how they are every other month. i feel like an asshole.  
i cant keep a job anymore cus of how im feeling, im months behind on rent thats put me in rent arrears, ive dropped out and lost a substantial amount of money from my student loans, meaning i wont be able to pay it by the time theyre demanding.  
i cant and dont eat properly, the most i get around to is a tin of peaches, and a small bowl of pasta and sauce, if anything.  
i just dont see life being worth living; i hate myself, i hate where i live, i hate my circumstances, i hate everything. but im scared of doing something bad to myself.  


in the off chance i do something horrible, i wanna apologise to my family. i know i never talk to any of you, but i do love you all so so so much, even if i never showed it well.  
i also wanna apologise to all of the people i met via online gaming communities, or just online social communities in general. ive been able to talk to some incredible people that have made me feel great in times of need, that no one in person has ever offered me.

unable to lose weight while morbidly obese,"i (22f) have a bmi of 52. its steadily increased my entire life. ive tried everything short of weight loss surgery (which im scared of due to the many possible complications) ive tried diets, ive tried multiple sports and exercise regiments, ive tried medications (more than i can count), ive tried intermittent fasting, ive tried unhealthy restrictive fasting, ive tried a nutiritionist. nothing works at all. part of this is because i have moderate/severe hidradenitis suppurativa. you can google it for more details, but the short and simple of it is its a skin condition that causes painful cysts to form due to friction, sweat, and other immune/hormonal factors. these cysts eventually open and become large lesions that take months to heal. its extremely painful and physically limiting. i get infusions for it every six weeks, but its chronic and i have not yet seen enough improvement to be able to work out as intensely as i need to. i also have pcos, meaning i struggle with insulin resistance too. im just completely miserable. i have a loving fiance and family, this isn’t about being unlovable. i just don’t feel like myself. when i look in the mirror i see a body that isn’t mine. when i dress myself i can’t put on clothes that are true to my identity because they just don’t make many clothes that are my size. the judgment that comes from my peers, whether it be online or directly to my face, gets to me. i want to run and jump and dance and feel beautiful. but im so lost in this meat prison that it feels like i will never be able to live a full life. in moments like this all i can think of is how it’s my fault for eating so much, but that isn’t even accurate to reality. at this point im eating once a day, barely breaking 500cals. it feels like im cursed. im struggling to see a reason to keep going when it feels so pointless. if i saw any progress at all id probably be able to motivate myself to keep going, but i havent seen any. ever. maybe this is it for me. maybe it’s time to finally give up.",pippynpoppy,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12crkrl/unable_to_lose_weight_while_morbidly_obese/
I wanna die idk how much more I can take.,"I'm 16 and just started school after being homeschooled since I was 7. 

I don't want to do this because of school, I want to do it because I keep fucking up. I can't keep my mouth shut, I'm stupid and don't fucking understand anything. I have a partner, they're amazing, they've dealt with it up till now.

I know they care about me, but sometimes I feel like they don't, like when they purposefully ignore my messages to scroll on Instagram, I can see that they're active, they ignore my goodnight messages and my ""I love you"" messages, which is okay, they can, they can decide when to talk to me, I hate myself for opposing that thought so much.

I wanna talk to them about this but I can't. I don't wanna put them through my thought process.

I'm three weeks sh clean today, I wanna tell them about that too, but I can't. I can't stop thinking about dying, and I know people would miss me, I know that, I do.

my cat stopped me from commiting suicide,"it sounds so cheesy, but hear me out.

Last week, I attempted suicide. I planned to do the wrist thing in the tub but... that didn't work, so I tried to fall asleep instead. I had my cat in there with me. I was scared of dying alone. I thought maybe if I had someone with me in my final moments I'd feel more peace as I passed.

He's not technically my cat, he's my sister's, but she lives with me and my dad so he acts like an everyone cat. 

At some point I guess he got worried because he started meowing and pawing at the tub. He kept jumping onto the ledge of it and trying to step into the water. 

I was frustrated because I couldn't fall asleep, the water was cold and the tub was really uncomfortable. So I just sat up because he kept waking me up. 

I drained the water from the tub and he stood on the ledge the whole time and watched it go down the drain. He stopped meowing and knocking at the tub after that. He just sat there with me.


I feel so bad for being frustrated with him. I didn't say anything to him, I just played with him for a bit and left to watch TV with him, but I was angry. And I said such mean things to my friends. I know I didn't do anything wrong, my friends all told me it was okay, but still. 

I don't know why he did that, but that little goblin saved me that day.",Themeowmeoww,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12cxkll/my_cat_stopped_me_from_commiting_suicide/
Was it an attempt,"So idk if this belongs here but I've always been in doubt about wether my actions were a proper suicide attempt. This is just to get some closure with myself as I've come a long way with depression fueled by a number of toxic relationships.

So it's the 24th of December 2019, I'm 14 and insanely depressed, I have no medication, my mother tells me it's just hormones (it wasn't), and I had the thought ""maybe I should kill myself"" lingering around my head for a long time.

I was by the laptop doing some work, when I had an episode, one thing leads to another, and solely from having my mind trigger an episode, I break the laptop by repeatedly hitting it over my head. My mum is pissed off and because its Christmas Eve tells me I'm not getting anything for Christmas.

Prior to this I had been going up on our roof, without anyone even noticing, and I'd always look down. The only thought in my head being ""but would the fall actually kill me?"". This time I was convinced I was going to jump off the roof and end all the suffering. I sat on the edge of the wall looking down, somewhat hesitant, with the only thing preventing me from doing it being my doubts as to wether the fall would kill me. In end I didn't jump and returned downstairs safely out of my own free will.

So here's my question. Does that actually constitute as a suicide attempt? It's something that's been on my mind for a number of years and in therapy I barely even speak about it. Thanks in advance and stay safe.",die_potato42,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12d3mjg/was_it_an_attempt/
Disabled a few years back and the big S word is becoming more of an option every day,"Complete spinal cord injury resulting in paralysis. Shit is fucked up bro. The not walking thing is whatever man I can live with that. It’s the dick not working, it’s the nonstop nerve pain, it’s these skinny ass atrophied legs that make me embarrassed to ever go out, it’s the feeling that I’ve become a burden to my family. That’s honestly the main one really. I try to be fully independent trust me I’m busting my ass but everything’s a thousand times harder. I kid you not if my parents weren’t alive I’d have done it already. I’m extremely bitter at life all the time dude it’s unbelievable that something like this could have happened to me. Never in a million fuckin years would I expect it to happen to me. I have nothing to gain from bragging I’m crippled so trust me this is just venting but I used to be a good looking guy man and I loved sex it was genuinely top 3 thing in the world. I talk to these wheelchair rugby guys and they say their lives are better since they got crippled there’s no way.

My mom told me to kill myself.,"Today I had an argument with my mom while we were walking my dog and she got really mad at me cause supposedly I took too much time in the shower and we were walking my dog late. She started bringing things like my school attendance, I possibly have the worst school attendance of the world this year, I've only been a couple of days cause I suffered bullying and a guy tried to fight me outside school with a knife and threatened to kill me; my mom started shouting a lot of things to me and it was really embarrassing cause we were in tbe middle of the street, after a while of shouting at me she finally said: ""it would be really great for the whole family if you killed yourself"". I couldn't believe it, I love my mom we've always been really united and she has gave me everything since my dad left us but this is possibly the worst thing she has said to me (she also said that no one would be attending my funeral cause no one likes me). I know its hard for her that I don't go to school regularly (even though she knows and she saw the bullying and the guy threatening me) but she can't say that to me out of nowhere, the only thing that is stopping me from killing myself is that I don't have a way to do it, I don't know anyone that has a gun or something like that (I have 0 friends).

The lowest I've ever been," I've been off meds for years now. I haven't been to any therapy or psychiatrists since 2018, and until now everything was manageable. I knew all of the signs and red flags to look out for and prepare myself for an episode, but this time everything is different. Without the meds and therapy, I had a plan B for when things got bad. I knew to always tell myself that it was temporary and things would start to get better soon. Over the last 2-3 weeks, though, I've been a ticking time bomb and I've never felt this low before. In 2016 I was involuntarily hospitalized, so now I'm terrified to let anyone know how badly things are going. I've tried to hint at my fiancé that things are pretty bad, but he's just sort of a ""get over it"" type of guy. He knows, in detail, about my diagnosis and what my past has held. He knows something is currently wrong. He has no idea how wrong. I've never hated myself and the idea of living more than I do now. No matter how small the task is, simply not being here feels so much easier. I have no need to exist. I don't have a purpose or anyone that needs me. I have no kids, I have minimal debt that I've insured won't fall on my family. I lost the majority of my friends and family when I moved away from my hometown. I know you're probably thinking ""you have a fiancé"", but we're young. We're kids. He's got time to find someone, settle down, and have his dream life. Why should I slow him down? He has a degree, a great job, hobbies he loves, and a massive support system. I'm a minimal fraction of his life. I'm a minimal fraction of my own life.

I've hit a point where I can no longer mask up some crap reason to stay here, and the bad thoughts I could once identify as ""bad thoughts"" are starting to sound logical. I bounced around from major to major in college, when the reality is I didn't ever plan to survive long enough to graduate. I never picked out a dream job, or house, or car. The closest thing to a goal I ever set was to some day make it out of my own messed up head. I'm probably too much of a coward to ever actually commit, but inside I'm gone.

Being an empath - Life's game was rigged from the start,"It took a while for me to realize just how much this - some would say gift, people like me would call affliction - has had me by the ghoulies my whole life. So many theories, so many trips to counselors, and what does it take for me to put two and two together? A TV show of all things, Hannibal in particular. So often throughout my life I've had this gut feeling, this underlying question of just how much my thoughts were my own or not. Turns out they probably weren't. So then, what exactly have I been all these years? Who even am I? Do I really hate myself enough to kill myself?

That one concept album about Alzheimer's disease, Everywhere At the End of Time, had a couple of ""fan sequels,"" one where the person goes to Heaven, and one where the person goes to Hell. The latter is naturally more relevant; it starts out harsh and abrasive, but then eventually fades to a dull emptiness. It almost feels like a parallel to my own life, and to spiritual pain in general. Anger, sadness, et al. at least show that you feel something still. I don't know what I actually feel myself, if anything. I don't think I ever have.

I'm not even so convinced that I ever had depression; I think I just find myself around miserable family members and miserable friends, so I just absorb their misery like a parasite into myself. Of course, human psychology being that it is, positive emotions don't do a single thing, because we've evolved to focus on negatives for our own survival. My brain decides to focus on everyone's negatives akin to a headless chicken, leaving whatever I even am yearning for an escape.

I can't think of the last time I've genuinely been happy. I tried being alone for a while; the emptiness hurt worse. I try being more with people; I glom onto their misery and feel bad anyways. It doesn't help them in any way, I just end up hurting myself - in more ways than just the intangible. It's an inexorable catch-22 that ""just being happy with myself"" doesn't fix because I don't even know if I'm capable of feeling genuinely happy. 

Tangible and intangible stressors merging as they have been the last few years, I truly don't see what the point is anymore. I ain't gonna be happy either way, and I don't think I'd even allow myself to be - whatever I am, that is. 30 years so far, and the contract is for another 30 at least?

I Don’t Want To Die But I Can’t Take It Anymore,"The main reason I don’t want to die is my family. They’re really great people and they’d be devastated to hear their son committed suicide.

I can’t remember the last time I was recently happy. If my family is my reason for living I have more reasons for dying.

I’m a burden to them a kid who came out the womb depressed and anxious. All my life they saw me with no friends and at my lowest lows. Luckily, my studious nature got me to a good uni for our area.

However, what’s the point. I realized I’ll be alone for the rest of my life. I’m too socially inept and stupid to understand my uni classes. I realize when I graduate I’ll have no friends, prospects, or degree to write home about. Because I detest most of my uni classes and honestly I don’t see how I’ll make a career out of them. I took a computer sci class but I’m not that good at it.

So I have no idea what to do. All my life I always get like this when I’m faced with a fork on the road.

"Sometimes, there is no 'getting better;.","It's especially hilarious when people bombard you with the stereotypical platitudes like, ""You are not alone"" and ""Go get help"". 

Yeah...I get that I'm not alone. That's what makes this even worse. I'm surrounded by people who either don't understand how much pain I'm in every day, are completely indifferent to it, or need me to stay because I provide financial / material support to them. In fact, if I really WAS alone, life would be a lot easier. 

'Get therapy / medication' is even more egregious. I work hard for decent Health Insurance, and it's impossible to find someone who accepts new patients, takes my insurance, and is willing to prescribe medication. That's assuming I'm willing to spend hundreds or thousands out of pocket for absolutely no benefit. 

I've been plugged into the mental healthcare system for over 30 years, and it is a crock of shit. It wasn't until a few weeks ago that I finally got a diagnosis of ASD and ADD. Up until then, I'd been told that I had 'medication resistant depression', and have been given every pill on the market. Decades of this have destroyed my life, and I'm now at an inflection point. 

For some of us, there IS no 'getting better'. 

I have a brain that is hardwired to drive me insane with sensory overload, and lacks the ability to comprehend even basic social cues / skills. Every day is a living hell in which I am forced to navigate a world that is hostile to my very being. Never asked to be born this way, and there is literally no escape from this. I'm just cursed to suffer until I die a 'natural' death? How is that right? 

Most people dream of wealth and success. I dream of scenarios in which I am killed, so my dependents can at least get a healthy insurance payout. 

I honestly don't know why there's such a stigma around making a conscious decision to end one's existence after a lifetime of pain and abuse.",Diligent_Potential30,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12ctdy3/sometimes_there_is_no_getting_better/

It works faster also if i put it on my tongue, I’m already sleepy as hell, i took it like 10-15 min ago..

I'm so tired and as a result of my depression everything in my life has been going downhill. School is stressful as fuck and my grades are shit even though I used to be a straight A student. In addition to that my household is just not the most positive environment. I have a shitty relationship with my dad and every other day he starts at raging at me for some stupid reason. I'm so tired of life and on top of that I have really bad trauma from sexual assault that I just cant seem to ever get rid of. Obviously it doesnt interfere with my day to day life but I'm just saying *everything* has been going downhill for the past few years and honestly there's no reason to live anymore. I tried reaching out to people for help but it didn't do any good, on the contrary, ive been met with extreme stupidity of people saying I don't seem depressed enough and even one person told me ""you will never kill yourself ur just saying that to try and make excuses"" 🤡 which is the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life.

I can't stand it anymore, I haven't been able to for a long time. My face, body, hair, etc. everything about me is so deformed and disgusting, and it's only gotten worse over the years. I would do anything to at least have a normal body. If I looked different, it wouldn't solve all of my problems but my life would be insanely different. I think the main cause of my depression and suicidal thoughts is how I look. I have completely cut off my friends because I don't want anyone to see me anymore. I'm even uglier and my body is even worse than it was years ago, and I just can't bear them seeing. I also have lost all personality. I'm a shell of a person. A guy I'm acquaintances with and hadn't seen in awhile tried having a conversation with me yesterday and I was so awkward, he probably wondered what tf was wrong with me. I can't even function cognitively, like he would tell me stuff and my brain took forever to process it. I feel like if my body was different, if my face was different, I would at least have some confidence and also would get help for other things I need help with. I would also have more hope in general. But my body just looks so fucked up and every time I try to fix it it just fights back harder. I have chronic bloating and I hate it so much, it used to just be after eating but now it is 24/7 from waking to nighttime, I don't know what's wrong with me, even without the bloating my body would still be ugly. My face just looks so dead and devoid of life, when I look at pictures from years ago my skin was so much more youthful, now I just look dead and I have trichotillomania so my eyebrows are fucked up. I don't know, I'm sure I have body dysmorphia, but even without the lens of dysmorphia my face and body are still ugly. I have completely lost myself, even talking to my family who I am close to I still can feel the lack of personality in myself, I have nothing interesting to say ever. I'm such a broken person, all I want is a healthy mind and normal looking body, I want to feel lovable, I want to have a desire to live and to socialize and do normal things, but I will probably kill myself before the end of this year because I'm in too much pain and life is not worth living for me. I feel like my problem sounds so pathetic and vain, so I'm especially afraid of trying therapy and telling someone about it, even though I feel like therapy won't help at all. I feel like nothing could help me, like things are beyond repair. I am never happy, I feel horrible during weekdays when I am at school, I usually go to my parents' house over the weekend and I can distract myself a bit by playing games and stuff but I don't enjoy them like I used to, I'm just trying to keep the thoughts away.

I'm so alone.,"I suffered from severe opiate addiction for most of my life. I got sober about 5 years ago and my life got really good. I got married, had 3 kids, had amazing job opportunities. My wife and I started fighting about an year and a half ago. She saw I was liking an ex-girlfriend of mine from high school's pictures on facebook. Her insecurity ate her up, no explanation I had would suffice. Through that we both lost absolute control. After a year of hell, agony, threats, and torture I ended up picking up a bunch of norcos and getting back to my old ways. I was in far too much pain to handle. I've since gotten sober again, I went to treatment and now planned to spend a month in sober living. I've been largely separated from my wife and kids for a majority of that time. I'm in so much agony from everything that has happened over the past year. I lost my kids, I lost my wife, I lost most of my job opportunities, I can't be home, my wife is still arguing with me. Not only am I miserable from everything that has happened, but I also can't help but obsess about my wife leaving me for someone else after the past year of hell. Every time we get back into an argument I snap into a panic attack/rage, she yells, I yell. After everything I emerge remorseful and in even more pain. It's now happened multiple times over the past week. She's extremely insecure and thinks that I will cheat on her or what have you even though I have continuously done everything I can to prove my love and loyalty to her, it seems thats what all of our fights are about nowadays. I'm so alone, I'm in so much pain. I am so fucking numb at this point. I can't see any light at the tunnel and I feel as though my actions have permanently prevented me from getting my family and life back. I'm sober now 45 days or so, I am diagnosed Bipolar and on various meds, but I think it may be more than that or maybe my meds aren't working again. I may appear calm and collected but when shit his the fan I can only think about ending it all.

I picked up 10 pressed fentanyl pills last night after another day of hell fighting with my wife. I can't take it anymore. She now won't talk to me again and I cant be home right now. I really dont have anyone left in my life and it seems it'll always be this way. I can't handle much more pain and if it gets to that point I now have an easy quick way to end it all.

I need help, but I don't think anyone can really fix anything that has happened over the past year. There's too much to address and I'll never get back the people I love. Every day seems to get harder.",aceoaceo,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12cw3ty/im_so_alone/

I'm probably going to end things soon.,"\[Tried posting this on r/TrueOffMyChest and it got removed, great way to start this, eh?\]

Don't know where to go or what to do, so I thought I'd try getting my thoughts down. Believe it or don't, judge if you want. I just hope whoever reads this tries to understand.

Engaged. First baby on the way. I've got so much to look forward to but I'm dreading it all because I'm worried I won't be able to provide the life for my growing family. My life feels like it's about to burst at the seams. I don't even know how to frame this post, so I'm just going to list the things I have on my mind.

Live in California. Housing market is trash and I don't think we can afford a halfway decent home in a safe area.  
Rent is sky high for even less space.  
Fiancee's family is mostly horrible and are emotionally abusing her. While pregnant. With their grandchild/niece.  
I work from home but feel completely disconnected from my job, sort of lost in the corporate sea.  
My family will struggle when I leave to move in with fiancee. Worried they won't make it.  
Grandmother (who currently lives with us) showing early signs of dementia. My folks can barely afford to live without me, doubt they afford extra care for her and my mom's extended family are largely hands-off when it comes to helping.  
Medical bills piled up. More on the way with the baby.  
Mental health is shit. Live with a constant pit in my chest that's now starting to physically ache. Can't afford therapy, even with insurance it's $200+ per session (and part of the reason I have medical debt - I had to cancel care because I couldn't afford the help - when I was seeking help to manage my anxiety over money and everything else!)  
There's more, but I'm so brain drained that I can't think of it all.

I'm sure a lot of this doesn't sound that bad. But to me, my world is crashing down around me. I love my fiancee and need to get her the hell away from her family but we can't seem to find a place that makes sense and I'm worried the stress is going to cause her to miscarry - and if she does I'll never, ever forgive myself for not doing more. I want to meet my daughter (especially after we had an early pregnancy scare) but I already feel like such a failure of a father because I can't promise her a safe place to start growing up. I love my family, they've depended on me for so long but I'm tired of being the anchor that holds everyone down. Of course I have friends, but they all have their own lives and there's no room for them to be worrying about my shit when they have so much going on too. Everyone would hate me if I left this world, but I'm starting to think that they'd all be better off without me dragging them all down into this pit. Misery loves company, why would I put that burden on them?

Not even sure why I'm posting this or what I'm looking for. A sympathetic ear? Validation that life sucks and is hard? Encouragement to just drop it all and fade away? What the fuck am I even doing here?

Whatever. Leaving this up for now because I don't know who else to turn to. Go ahead and ask questions. Fuck it, go ahead and judge me and call me a horrible partner/father/son. No one can possibly make me feel worse than I already do. Leaving this life behind may sound like the ultimate selfish act, but it's the only thing I feel like I have true control over. If that makes me a bad person, then so be it.

And overall, just missing him and the pain of thinking about him during his last moments, all the suffering he went through during his life and how lonely he must’ve felt too.

Randomly feeling suicidal sometimes then feeling okay. Making any sense?,"18m if that helps.

I've been suicidal many times over the course of three years and previously went through a break-up with my ex girlfriend back in February. I've been successful in holding down a job as of recently, working with kids in an amusement park where I make £10.42 hourly and hope to work towards my dream of becoming a game developer, so essentially i'm bootstrapping to progress forward in life.

I was on my way home yesterday and I felt this wave of depression while on the bus, nearby in the town I was in at the time - there is a famous bridge. I thought about ending my life there and cried for some time, had some people look at me and I thought everything was bad for a while as the ride went on even though my life is going well. 

I felt fine as soon as I got home though. I feel like I should add that i've recently finished normal therapy and will be returning to do CBT in a few months to help with unresolved trauma, but if anyone has any idea why I randomly feel this way at times then please tell me.

Depressions Sucks,"I've been feeling like this for years now, but recently it's been getting a lot worse.

It started out as just occasional anxiety but has evolved to bad anxiety attacks, suicidal thoughts, and self-harm.

Everyone I've ever talked to about my feelings have all just stopped talking to me. I'm always the first to initiate conversations and I feel like I'm losing my bonds with everyone.  I don't trust anyone enough irl with my feelings anymore because if how many times people say ""I'll be there for you,"" but never are when I ask for help.

I've been through 3 therapists already with none of them being helpful to change what I've become, but my insurance changed so now I can't even afford a new one. I don't trust the suicide help lines enough to actually call and talk to them because of stories I've heard. Sure they could all be fake but if they aren't and I do call, I don't want that risk.

The scariest thing is how all my plans have changed. I used to have one solid plan, but now I have 3 good plans all of which I have researched online via ncbi.nlm.nih.gov with all of them being very lethal. Two of the options are cheap on amazon and one is only $400 which isn't that much in the grand scheme of things. So with many backups and a very easy way to access them it's getting a lot harder to hang on, especially since my fingers are getting very tired. I'm just afraid if I can't find the right person to help I'll make the impule purchase and eventually finish the job.

I've been staring at the number 8 on my keyboard for the last 3 hours.,"I'm 25 years old and i've struggled with bullying and anxiety as a result of bullying my whole life. I was the kid that whenever they got of the bus, people would shout and throw things at me. I had one friend during school, I would probably have called him my ""Best"" friend that I ever did have. When I left school at the age of 16 my mother wouldn't allow me to see him anymore because he lived in a bad part of the city. That basically stopped the last friendship that I ever did have.

From the age of 16 to 20, 4 years... I stayed in my room. I looked at a screen. I did not, could not work. My anxiety was crippling, I would wake up late, do nothing, go to bed late... And find myself awakened to repeat it over and over again. Sometimes when night fell, I would stand in my doorway... Just staring at my small room and break down into a flow of tears because I didn't want to go to bed. I didn't want to go to sleep because I knew that the same thing was waiting for me day in and day out. 

I was prisoner to my own anxiety. And although I have tried to better myself, the damage has been done and I am to far gone.

At the age of 20 I did find a job, this job forced me to speak to hundreds of customers each day. I knew and spoke to the colleagues that I worked with and was stupid enough to think that because we worked together that we would have been considered ""Friends"". No. Everyone that comes into my life is just an acquaintance that slowly fades away into obscurity. No one is ever there for long. 

I am 25 now. I have been in this retail job... Long enough to see many faces come and go, despite working here and attempting many different hobbies that were meant to better my soul, I have zero friends.

I mean... I'm 25 years old, I haven't had a birthday celebrated for me in 9 years. I have never been kissed. Strange things happen to your soul when you have been void of human connection for so long. For the longest time I only ever wanted to be held by someone. Now I just want it to be over.

I came home from work today, I have stared at my keyboard for hours. Just thinking about how their really is no point. If I go, its not like anyone is going to be around to feel? My job role will be replaced. The friends that i've never had, I won't be missed. The love that I've dreamed of, will never exist.

The relationship was not good and it wasn't one I could kesve or my life would of been f***Ed sooner, after she got comfortable the abuse and r@pe started, she would pull knicee to me and eventually it got too much and I just left(I could never go to my mum bc she would of blamed me and aas also homophobic) but then all that started it never stopped ans I left she had told me if I told anyone then she would fk shi up for me so I kept quiet but then she went and she done it anw so I had to leave the school, it has been non stop harassment and my school is about 20 miles away from my old one, she has got people to beat me up in school and aplsorts, I have no friends apart from 1 person who had tried to ohs last night and I feel like he ant gna stick around in this world, im done I didn't see myself being here this long and I got no plans or when I leave school in a few weeks before exams. Iam honestly stuck as school is my only stability in life as my parents also recently broken up but are really giving mixed signals bc one min they r over then the next rhea on sofa cuddling as 'best friends' now my home life isn't too god either, my mum is absive and my dad has sa me when we was on holiday without my mum about 2 years ago.

"My last $5, no job, it's time.","I'm a 28 male. 2 years ago I sold my business and invested all my money into fixing my girlfriends house that she inherited. The plan was to remodel then sell the house. After using all my credit cards to buy materials ($20,000 debt), she cheated on me, lied to get me kicked out, and divorced me about 1 year ago, leaving me with the debt, and taking the house.

Moved back in with my family, but they all lied and used me for personal gain. I moved out and started living in my truck about 8 months ago.

I had 1 friend left but he's an alcoholic and only kept getting worse, so I stopped talking to him after he tried to fight me because I wouldn't get drunk with him.

I've completely lost all trust in people. I haven't talked to another human being in about 7 months, besides the occasional store clerk. People have broken me to the point that I have extreme anxiety being in public or talking to anyone (I was never like this, the complete opposite actually. Very outgoing.)

I've been selling all my stuff on ebay to survive and I'm out of stuff to sell. I have $5 left in my account. I refuse to get a job and have to deal with people anymore. I won't stoop low enough to beg for money either.

I knew this time would come and now I'm here. There is a lot more that I want to say and explain, but what's really the point?

I'm terrified of the unknown. My mind races, trying to think of another option so I can continue to survive, I'm even writing this in hopes of someone giving me a solution, but I know there is nothing any of you can do. This is my own problem, I've broken down and there is no coming back. I don't want to live in a world where the closest people to me, can cause this amount of pain.

I have a goose neck, a buffalo hump, I am overweight with no butt or shape, a large back, wide shoulders, saggy boobs, can’t lose weight I have tried everything, tiny dull eyes, tiny lips, no jawline, a BIG head, a large forehead, big pointy nose, I look like a man, zero energy or enthusiasm and don’t even get me started on my personality…it’s also the worst. I can’t explain it. It’s just so so so dull and empty. I feel SO FUCKING guilty 24/7 because I can’t feel empathy. I have never been able to have an intelligent conversation or ideas/thoughts. I can’t participate in conversations about anything. It’s just all about existential dread and gloom and self hate. If I’m not thinking those things or having anxious thoughts it’s just blank. I believe I have a very low iq. I was always the one in class to not understand anything. Because of my looks/personality/low intelligence I have only had 3 friends in my life but have had zero friends for 12 years now and I’m 26. On top of everything, I have schizoaffective bipolar 1 type. Obviously I have been extremely depressed for years because of everything. I can’t feel joy or fun. I can’t even enjoy TV anymore. I have never felt an ounce of peace of mind in my life. Every solidarity second is dread. I literally feel like I’m in hell and am cursed. I’m sorry this sounds so whiny but I just wanted to vent this out to the void. Also sorry this is all over the place. I can’t write in good format either. I haven’t found ONE person I can relate to.

I turn 21 next month,"She should be turning 21 too. She is forever 13 though. Forever a first year teen. I have never been the same person after she died. She was my best friend, my only friend, my first friend, and my first love. I cared for her so much. 

She killed herself. She had moved a few hours away a few months before she died, and we lost a lot of contact. I didn’t talk to her enough. She was lonely. 

I stayed the night with her at her moms house when she was home for her once a month visit. Her house was just a few houses down from mine. I fell asleep, with her beside me, and woke up with her so much further away. She was on the bathroom floor, dirty, surrounded by her hoarder alcoholics mom trail of trash, bleeding out. I tried, I covered her arms, I tried to tell her to breathe, slapped her… but she was gone. 

Nobody cared. Her mom was not fazed.. she was so numb and robotic after years of frying her brain. There wasn’t much commotion, an ambulance came and went quickly, and a single police man lingered for maybe 15 minutes more, walked me back to my house, and told my mother the news. And then they were gone. Like nothing has happened. No sirens, just a few lights. I’m sure the whole street slept through it while my world was crashing down. The first thing my mom asked was if I could stop crying. She said it was fine, it’s sad but I have to move on now. She wasn’t a good influence anyways. 

That was the first night I stole her pills and got high. So as our birthdays approach, only separated by 8 days, I dream of shooting up, even though I’m nearly 5 months sober now, 3 years from heroin…I can’t handle the pain of the trauma of knowing I failed you. I am so sorry, baby. Forever 13. I want to follow you.",clitstickers,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12cdvvx/i_turn_21_next_month/
It really is all my fault.,"I have borderline personality disorder amongst other mental illnesses, and it's been extremely difficult.

I also- Im afraid of getting anything done, I have a fear of being productive and working towards goals. I'm a perfectionist, related to a lot of trauma, I don't like to make mistakes. Logically, life is filled with mistakes- but that's why I don't get anything done. I don't know how to organize my time, I take long doing everything when I actually start on any task.

Every job I've ever had has come to shambles dye to intense social anxiety and panic attacks.

I have a victim mentality that I cant seem to get out of. I'm a burden on myself, on my family, on society.

I’m so numb towards death,"I’m not here for any help, I just wanted to say all of it so I can make sense of it. It’s been pretty rough inside my head for the past couple days. I turned into my worst self, did the worst things and hurt the person I love the most. I was so calm too while destroying their personal property as if something took over me. I have embodied evil for her at this point. If somebody did that to me, I would too. It all happened in a course of 24 hours, it slowly unfolded. A day before, my parents had been fighting and my mother did the same thing that I repeated- she broke everything in sight. I think I took a step ahead by actually diving through my sister’s things and finding everything she absolutely loves and her savings, i handpicked those out and destroyed them. 

I’ve just been in bed all day today, desperately wanting to off myself. I don’t see many prospects and if I continue with this behaviour, I’m so scared I will start giving in and these won’t be episodes anymore, just somebody who I am. I ordered some morphine and I think universe intervened today and he couldn’t deliver today but I’m getting it tomorrow morning. I’ve booked a hotel and I’m going to do it. Why am I not scared? Im not not scared too. I just feel nothing. I feel like I could do this, everyone will be sad for sometime but it will be a relief that my hyper erratic self is not around. Idk why I’m here, I’m just writing this in the hopes that somebody will get me and tell me it’s okay to just do it. I don’t want to feel the guilt that’s naturally coming with it. Do I just want to die because I’m not ready to face consequences of my actions? Is it just that?! On the other hand, why can’t I choose when I want to die?

My lack of success is what will lead me to leave this place.,"I'm tired of trying and getting nowhere. I'm not getting any younger, I'm not getting any smarter, and I'm just exhausted.  I'm tired of working for people that don't care about me. I want to be in control of my career. So I tried it. For 2 years I've been trying to make a living as an artist/graphic designer and I'm failing. Not even failing, full on failed. Its going nowhere.

It all sounds so simple right?  You have the talent but you just need customers. Start a Facebook page, Instagram etc. etc. but no. It's like screaming into the void. Customers trickle in but its not enough.  Rent is due, bills are due, your kid needs money for this and that, car needs maintenance etc. etc. It's money. You need money to live a happy life. I don't care what anyone says, its money. I don't have any. 

I've been fired or let go from just about every job I've had. I don't want to work for someone else anymore. This whole situation make me feel absolutely stupid. Plenty of ways to make money on your own but I'm too stupid to figure out how.

The last retail job I had, I walked out on because I was having suicidal thoughts. They felt so real. It was actually calming, like I knew peace was coming. 

I know I'm rambling and a lot of this probably doesn't make a lot of sense.

Is it normal to have suicidal thoughts even when not depressed?,"My life is okay. I don't really have any problems. I had kinda a shitty childhood like bullying and my father was physically abusive, but nothing special. I have a place to stay, I have friends and people who care about me, a dog, I'm doing fine financially, last year I started my photography ""business"" and it's going fine. But 2/3 months ago my girlfriend left me out of nowhere and it was a huge shock for me. We were together for almost a year and it was the closest and the best relationship I even had even tho there were some problems she just abandoned me and didn't want to work it out. I also found out last year that I probably have OCD, specifically relationship OCD. It was and still is really hard to be on my own again, even tho for the majority of my adult life I wasn't in a relationship and I was doing fine. I battled with depression and anxiety like 5-6 years ago and took medication and got better. Now after the breakup and even during the relationship I had a lot of anxiety (due to the OCD) and mby I was also depressed idk. Four weeks ago I started taking SSRI antidepressants again mainly for the anxiety and it helped a lot. But I feel like I just don't want to live anymore. Like I just don't want to be dealing with living anymore. It was always at the back of my head that my life with end in suicide at some point. I don't think I'm depressed now, but I find myself thinking about suicide a lot. I feel like it's so hard for me to be happy and I don't know why. Now I know I have this bullshit OCD thing that is sabotaging my relationships and it just sucks. Because relationships are very important to me. I feel like i'm never satisfied with where I am in life. Like nothing is enough and I don't know why. I'm lost and I'm trying to tell myself that if I do this and this and mby choose a different career it will get better and I will be happy, but I don't think that's true, because it happened before. Like with my business. I didn't want to work for someone else and I wanted something that's just mine, so I started the business and when I did that it felt great for a while, but now I don't really see why I did it in the first place. It's good for money, but it doesn't fulfill me in any meaningful way. I have this though that there was always a part of me missing a part that other people seem to have.. I don't know what it is exactly. Like there's a void inside me that can never be filled or fixed. Like I should be happy I have basically everything I wanted and I don't have to worry about shit, but I'm still not and I don't know if I'm capable of being. I feel like i'm broken beyond repair. I recently re-watch Bojack Horsemen and I relate to it so much. It's crazy how much it describes what I feel like.

Farewell,"Final post, goodbye everyone. 




I am completely worthless and I don't deserve to get better. I am a trash. I am poop. I should be abused.   That is the only way people can see me in anything other than a dirty mess.  If I was good enough, they would be nicer. They could love me more than this. But no, because I don't have it in me, I'm disgusting and nothing will change that.   

I'll just become a worthless person until the end of my days, and then people will just be sickened by what I am. No one will want to take care of me, because they think of me as someone who deserves to be neglected. Because I am disgusting, not worthy of being loved or treated well. 

I am a freak. The most disgusting human being alive. I don't belong here. Not now and certainly not ever. Sooner rather than later, the monsters are going to kill me and throw my body out into the ocean like trash. Like any other garbage. And I deserve every bit of it. And I hate myself for making my parents sad. I don't deserve to be alive. 

I'm a waste, like garbage bags dump out. I'm not worth keeping, and no one wants to keep trash like me. And I know that.   My parents says so. Every time my parents look at me, I can feel the hate coming off them. I am a waste. Like a piece of meat. Nothing more. Or nothing less. I am disgusting and useless.  

I should die. And that's the reality of life. There is no escape from it. The monsters want me dead. To prevent my existence. And I'm fine with that. Because I deserve it.

Pedestrian Zebra crossing accident.,"A lot of cars do not stop. In my country, I have the right of way. I want to be dead right by victimising myself using the faults in road design and driver's mistake. This way my death or injury will seem legitimate.

I will not jump randomly in front, but to the letter of the law on a busy zebra crossing with high speed sharp turns and a lot of blind spots.

I need to make it stop.,"I can’t do this anymore.

Nothing makes me happy.

I took the meds. I’ve been in therapy. I’ve done all the coping mechanisms and self talk that I could do. I tried to change the way that I viewed myself.

And for the past year, I did pretty okay!! But lately… I can’t feel anything good inside. Punching things doesn’t help. Music is so bland and grey to me now. Orgasms are a dull short 60 seconds of illusionary serenity. 

I try talking to people but… it doesn’t help. I’ve noticed that nobody asks how I am. How I’m doing. How I’m feeling. They just want something from me. And that’s okay for customers!! That’s how I can stay alive!! But my family, my friends, everybody… they don’t care about me anymore. Not like that. Not in the way I need. Sure they’ll ask what’s up, but they don’t care about what I say. They just wanna talk about their lives.

I just… I just… I wanted somebody to care about me. I wanted somebody to worry about me.

I wanted somebody to love me.

But that can’t happen. And if it does it’s just a temporary set up for more pain. I’m done. I can’t do this. I’m already in so much pain. So much neglect and rejection.

How do i talk my internet friend down?,"She's fully intent on committing suicide in two days. She has been planning it for at least five days, maybe even longer. 

She has had a bad life. 

Here is the context (which you can skip, the actionable part of this will be at the bottom): 
Her beloved grandmother died recently, she has extensive childhood trauma (self harmed at 12, disclosed to a trusted family member who then spread the word to her family who told her she has no reason to be cutting since she was not raped or molested, then threatened to put her in a straightjacket in a mental hospital- i know straightjackets are outdated and she does too now- and the dad then told her she was an embarrassment to the family, spread the word around town that she self harmed and was a disappointment, they even told their bosses, then at 17 a family friend stayed at their house for two months and grabbed her ass and the family defended him, her mother does the laundry and makes food for her adult- i think older?- brother so he can do whatever he wants and he is not mentally challenged, merely entitled), she is experiencing unavoidable harassment and abuse at her workplace (her coworker tells her she is bossy and bitchy even though she only talks to her when she needs to ask her to do something- she is said coworker's boss- the coworker also spreads lies that she is mean and shitty towards her like telling people that she has to ask my friend in order to leave the building. The truth is it is a RULE that she must TELL her when she leaves the building because they are in the medical field and my friend must know where everyone is at all times in case of emergency. This coworker says to others that my friend is rude and that she is sick of her shit. Once this coworker bought pizza for everyone else and when there were leftovers, said ""looks like theres no one else to give it to, lets take it downstairs!"" This coworker is also withholding patient information from my friend. This coworker is also 50 years old. There was a meeting about this asshole bullying my friend and the other coworkers there were friends with the asshole. So they stuck up for her and management told my friend they couldnt do anything since ""there wasnt a problem."" And she struggles with major anxiety and depression. The pills dont do shit and the waiting time to get an appointment with a psychiatrist is months. 


The actionable part:
Moving away is the only solution she sees working but it won't happen because it would cost $20k and she doesnt have the collateral for a loan and her parents naturally won't help. Her mom has made it clear she would sabotage any attempt of hers to move out of town. 
I told her i could get her 19k in seven months if she could hold on that long (if i worked full time and sent nearly every dollar her way). We are very good friends and shes gay, i promise im not simping. And this wouldnt be the first time i gave over 19k to a friend in need. 

She declined. 

I tried coming up with ways i could shorten the time to five months but she keeps telling me no, she is intent on suicide. 

I've suggested she work some min wage job while i supplement her income to keep her out of her parents house but she declined that as well. 

She's declined every solution and every piece of encouragement i or my friends can think of

I told her if she followed through, she'd be killing herself on my birthday. Which is true. I doxxed myself to prove it to her. She intends on doing it anyway

All that's left now, i think, is to try to get her to share some kind of social media that has people that know her irl and get them to call emergency services for her on the day of. Which is what i did last time for someone else.

I need someone to talk to about advice,"Throw away account for many reasons. I don't know if I still want to live but this is assuming I do. My only options for long term stability is to skip town and get a job in the city get back into being an escort essentially. I'm in online treatment so that shouldn't be an issue per say. I want to wait to see my therapist first but my opinions are skip town with my savings, sell my desktop and buy a laptop rather for working online and casual games but nothing major at that point I was doing really well until my mental health took a toll. I feel like the only way to protect is to disappear. Leave my mom and partner who I feel aren't helping me and making me worse. Finaces are the main issue I can't escort in a small town obviously. But I also can barely afford to keep myself alive I just missed a credit card payment already and owe a lot. I have an income but it's not enough. So my one plan is to just buy a bus ticket and stay in backpackers while doing outcalls if I can afford my own room maybe incalls to. I will take the pics and post ads beforehand and I have a few friends in that city aswell if shit really gets to much. Here I have no one. I didn't want to come here I barely fucking remember it as it is and I'm loosing control easily. I know the reasoning for coming here was for a better life with someone who I guess is my partner I can see why he's the only person I have right now but he's holding me back. Hospitals can't help me And I can't tell my family they don't care. I have to get through this shit somehow. I just feel so bad for leaving my partner he can't come with me as of now. No car I'd take a bus. As it is I have to find a home for my cat and sell my pc.

The last paragraph of my suicide note.,"Me- You aloud your own expectations to ruin your joy in life. You felt like you should have accomplished more by this age. You lied. You hurt people closest to you. You self sabotaged. You pushed people away that were simply trying their hardest to love you. You were fully aware and yet you still fell short you were still weak. You let comparisons to other peoples life take your joy away. You use sex and alcohol to fill the void of joy in your heart. You were impatient and inconsistent. You hate to reminisce because you’re only 23 and genuinely don’t feel like you’ll ever be as happy as you were in the past again. You messed up nearly every opportunity given to you. You were prideful at times you should’ve been humble and a coward at times you should’ve been brave. You spoke too much and listened too little. I miss how confident and happy you used to be. How hard you worked. How optimistic you used to be. I miss you. I been waiting for you to get yourself out of this depression and grow into a better man but its not happening. You’ve cried nearly everyday this year. You can’t even enjoy moments of happiness because you know you aren’t truly happy you’re just distracting yourself from the pain. You didn’t love yourself enough.

"""If you do anything stupid I'll be the next one""","I'm a coward who has thought of killing herself since 16 and is already 24.

Begging for help has never worked.When I said I had suicidal thoughts for the first time, my parents pulled the ""selfish fuck"" card. My friends grew tired of my negativity and called me an asshole when they found me with the knife near my neck. Therapy has been useless, I've been told by 'the best' psychologists in my turn  that ""all I need is a beating"" and that I'm just victimizing myself. I've had ups and downs in my life like everyone, times when I was okay with existing and times when I cried myself to sleep just to cry again when I woke up alive. The latter is how I've been feeling these days, and it's just so bad that my family showed me pictures from my worst moment until now and said I was happy back then (I wasn't).

For context, I've studied a degree for 4 years at a different town and find myself living with my parents until I finish my final project and graduate. My hometown is a mess of a place, dirty, full of gangs and crooks, and with nothing for young people. I lost all my friends because they went on with their lives while I didn't. I can't work because the only places where I could work are supermarkets or bars, and they always reject my CV. I see no exit from this hellhole.

My grandparents, who raised me as if I was their daughter, have come to my house today to try to comfort me. My grandma in particular has always felt a special connection with me because her life was also a mess and she's gone through several depressions, but she has more willpower to keep going than I do. After seeing my current state, she told me: ""Keep living even if it's just for me, because if you jump I'll jump with you"". I know she was trying to encourage me to live, but at the same time I feel like I'm being held hostage.

The whole thing with AI is making me feel like ending it,"Hey, so M23 here, first time posting. I've been having a rough day today, so I figured I'd post here.

As we all know, AI is kind of exploding right now and it seems that every other day it can do something new and is getting more and more advanced. I'm an artist I guess, I am educated in 3D art and I like doing art on the side. I'm also interested in game design and writing. I don't have much more *marketable* interests beyond those. Seeing new advancements in image generation and chat models makes me feel like shit. Makes me feel like the value of my craft is diminishing rapidly and those skills that I do have won't matter anymore in the future.

I get the benefit of AI in advanced technology or medicine, or whatever, but in the creative arts it just seems so unnecessary and taking away from the human experience. It is being developed by tech geeks who want to see if they can and it will be pushed into the mainstream by capitalists because its cheaper and faster than hiring actual people to create art. None of those groups don't really have a grasp on why people decide on doing art in the first place. We enjoy the process and we don't really care enough about anything else. And now, our efforts are losing their value because of basically other people messing with our business. 

The very definition of art is *The expression or application of human creative skill and imagination.* And we're just going to keep seeing machines do it for us. 

I tried to rationalize it, I really did, I thought about how AI relates to painting vs the camera, but its different. The camera allowed us to do something we've never been capable of doing, capturing reality as it is. The painting still had a purpose after that, in fact, it had free reign to become weird. I don't see it as the same thing with this. This is taking something that already exists and turbocharging it to the point that the humans become obsolete, and the only real benefit is from a capitalistic standpoint. 

I tried thinking of it as just another tool, but its also different. Photoshop and graphic tablets brought a new workflow and sped up a lot of things, but using them still takes actual skills. AI replaces all the time and effort put in learning perspective, staging, color theory, anatomy, forms, lighting with writing a simple sentence. How fucking sad.

I tried thinking about it as something to just speed up grunt work, but it will never stop there. Soon it will generate entire stories, entire worlds, entire games, entire songs and albums, entire videos and movies and it will be all done with some sentences and minimal tweaks. And you know what? I simply don't want it. I don't care. I don't care about what a computer can put together. I've always appreciated and was always drawn to things because of their human factor. All I've ever cared about is human expression. And now, at 24 and fresh out of University, on the ""start"" of my life, I'm already feeling behind and burnt out and tired of it all. I'm seeing a world that's trying to rid itself of its humanity as fast as possible by boxing us all in a little corner of technology while taking in the ad revenue. Its making me try really hard to not see a reason why I should not opt out of it and why other people shouldn't too. 

Even as a consumer its fucked. Every time I see digital art, I have to make a small mental check and ask myself ""Is this real?"" I'd sift through all the furry porn in the world if it would mean being sure actual people made every piece of art that I see anywhere. And soon it will be text, it will be videos and all kinds on other things (While we're at it, fuck deepfakes)

The only hope I have going is that AI will oversaturate the entire digital world to the point that actual hand-made crafts and art spike in popularity and appreciation, and there's a rise in some sort of neo-hippie communities or lifestyles that shun these technologies in favor of actual human contact. Literally the only thing that keeps me going. If it doesn't come to that, might as well chug some bleach.

suicidal people are privileged,"according to my mom, apparently.

It was dumb of me (f22) to talk about the incident with the man who killed himself after talking with an ai for six weeks. I understand that suicide isn’t a good conversation starter, but my mom is someone who actively seeks out murder documentaries so I thought this topic would spark her interest.
I guess I was wrong. She just said that he was privileged and ungrateful and ended the conversation there.
She knows that I’m suicidal as well, so I can’t help but this that she was insinuating that I was privileged and ungrateful for having suicidal ideations. 
It brought up a lot of other memories like how I casually said that I wanted to visit Shizuoka, and how she responded with “is it because of the suicide forest there?”

Fuck I'm so tired.,"Just putting my thoughts down.

1. About to get married. It's been such a fucking mission. My parents have been the fucking worst, my fiancee hates my mom and now I'm staring at the possibility of a married life where my mom and my wife will have to keep separate and where my wife won't want our kids to ever spend time with her.

2. Having to wait this long while pandering to my parent's fucking deranged grab of control during this process, I now have to spend money I'd spend buying a house on IVF because my fiancee is convinced she's run out of time.

3. Shit my parents did fucked up my burgeoning business too. I was so close, so fucking close, to making bank before my parents went off and ruined my reputation with anyone they could fucking talk to. Now I'm stuck back in corporate and I hate every single day of it.

4. Dying seems like the ultimate solution. I get to get out of this nightmare, my pretty fiancee is free to get married to someone without snakes for parents, she'll get money, I'll give my parents some money too, I'll probably give my siblings money too. And hopefully some kind of lesson comes out of this so my parents treat my siblings better when they get to this milestone.

To not d*e yourself imagine everyone you love...,"If you are suicidal, it proves that no one was there for you, no one tried to understand you.

I'm bipolar and if you didn't know no one is born bipolar it all comes from childhood trauma, and depending on my cycle, I reach the absolute rock bottom, and it's always for the same stupid reasons, my family just completely ignores me and my feelings. Then I choose to ignore them in return, I'm stuck in a void of silence, I speak to no one on earth, like I'm in a solitary confinement for days, even months, I imagine them all dead, I don't picture them dead, I don't want them dead, I want the best for them, but they truly don't exist to me anymore, it doesn't feel good but honestly it feels way better than having your feelings invalidated, being ignored, mistreated and insulted.

when someone is begging you to speak to them because they ""miss your presence"" it's a CAP! I cave in everytime and within, I swear to you seconds, after days, weeks, or even months of talking to absolutely no one, I'm ignored again, I'm called crazy again, I'm suddenly wrong again, my feelings are invalidated again!

Thoughts out of nowhere with no justification,"So I’ve been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, about 2 months. The very first time it seemingly came out of no where. I don’t think I’m depressed, but I honestly can’t tell. Things haven’t been good recently, but they certainly haven’t been bad. I don’t know why but the thought of killing myself has just seemed so appealing recently. Everything I’ve been anxious about and the negative feelings I’ve felt could just go away if I do it. I feel terrible. I feel even worse because I can’t find justification as to why I would want to do such a thing. I have a good life right now. So many others have it so much harder than me yet I still feel the way I feel. I feel like a waste. I can’t and don’t really want to talk about this with a professional either, since it’ll most likely affect my job (I’m in the military). I just can’t shake the feeling that I won’t have to worry about anything ever again if I did it. And it makes me feel worse. I know there are people who would care about me dying. These thoughts are selfish, but I can’t stop. I shouldn’t feel this way but I do. Its confusing. I feel like I’m simply tired of living. I don’t even know what I’m asking by posting on this subreddit. Advice? Maybe just to rant?

alright.,"i was clean from cutting for almost 5 months, and recently started back up again. 
my legs are completely sliced, i refuse to do it on my arms anymore because of the comments i get, plus they’re already too mitigated and i’d just be cutting over scar tissue everywhere. 
i finally just want to give up. 
i am not worthy of anything in life, and i never have been. 
i’m not loveable or loved, and i’ve turned completely cold. i used to be an absolute angel then i guess too much happened and turned me into a mess and now all i care about is what ways i can finally end it. 
i’m not successful. i’m not rich. i’m not important to anybody. 
nobody will miss me. not actually. people may say they would and act like they give a shit when they’re worried about you but they don’t ever genuinely care. people only “care” so they can feel better about theirselves, because people don’t bring flowers to funerals for gratitude, they bring them for regret. 
nothing i will ever do will fucking matter. 
i will literally never fit in anywhere, or have any real friends, any real relationships, any stable jobs, and any glimpses of hope. those are all gone and have been for a long time. 
i’m just not meant to be happy or to be here. life isn’t for people like me…

Living with people is causing me suicidal thoughts,"I don’t know if anybody will be able to help much or if this should belong on another sub, but I’m so sensitive to and hate noise, and it doesn’t help living with family who make me prone to always hearing something. Something that doesn’t help is that my siblings seem to have developed obsessive behaviours like shutting doors constantly, make an unbearable humming noise almost like a tic, and my sister (I don’t know if my brother might eventually develop this) shakes her head all the time which seems like a type of tic too, that triggers my hatred of movements (which I have as well as hatred of sound). My sister seems to shout/yell a lot too. My siblings do other things that trigger me too. It bothers me the most when they didn’t used to do these types of behaviours. Things that trigger me can be to do with my parents too. 

All of this causes me to feel stressed out all the time, and anxious of being around situations like this. I constantly have my ears covered as a result as people making noise can be when I don’t expect it.

I’ve got nothing left,"I finally felt awake again, I finally felt like me again. I was *happy*. I was actually fucking *happy*. My partner… he made me believe again. After years of just going through fucking motions and trying so hard to hope and be happy again, I really believed, for three days straight, that this was it, and I was gonna be happy forever. I trusted him. I let myself be so vulnerable and open and trusting. I gave into it. I believed with all my heart and soul, that this was gonna be a new start, full of love and happiness for us both. I’d been dead inside for years, and suddenly, I hoped again. It felt *real* again.

And while I was so utterly vulnerable, all my guards down, he threw me right back to the wolves. He basically told me that things were just gonna revert back to that awful cycle of “OK” and “bad,” back and forth ad infinitum. All my fears were correct. He crushed every good feeling I had in me. He blames me. He’s the only one that can fix it, and not only will he definitely fucking not, I don’t know if there’s actually anything he could do to fix it. All my trust is gone. If he could love me in every way that I could have wanted, and then just do what he did… I don’t know what this fucking world is anymore. I don’t know who he really is. And if that beautiful thing wasn’t it… then there’s nothing good out there for me. I’m done. I’m done. I can’t do this again.

I wish he’d never kissed me, and that’s the worst feeling I’ve ever felt. Even worse than the deaths, the betrayals of friends and family… to not even want to have another chance with him, to not even want to go back to those good times with him… there’s just nothing. There’s nothing for me. The world is evil if something like this can happen. I don’t want any part of it. 

That’s it. I’m done. I wished I’d died when I was 14, and I made my first suicide attempt.

i genuinely think that the only thing that can make this go away is dying. i don’t know how i’ll do it yet, but it’s a consistent thought. 16m

for the past year, i’ve been addicted to sexting online. i’m straight, but older men extorted me and i sometimes willingly sent photos. these are out there, and range from simple pics to videos with my face doing weird fucked up custom requests. i hate it. but that’s not the worst. 

i decided the best way to find actual girls was to make a fake account as a lesbian teen. got fake pics, and posted my username online. sure enough, was added by a girl around my age. she said she was 17, but i didn’t think about it too much. fucking stupid. we traded some pics and she sent about 10 pics/vids, some with face. nothing weird, just normal things. the fucked part is when i decided to save one. she immediately deletes the others, and tells me to delete it. i do it, and show proof. she starts threatening me, says she’ll call the police and she’s a minor and all that. i am a piece of shit. even if it was consensual it’s illegal, and I wasn’t who she thought i was. i could go to jail man. i want to stop doing shit like this but every time i do it again. something’s seriously wrong with me.

a couple nails in the coffin, crippling nicotine addiction, grades are shit, i’m extremely uncomfortable with my appearance, lots of anxiety, and i just want it to stop. i can envision myself amounting to anything, and i’ve been taken advantage of and taken advantage of people. why can’t it go away. i just wanna be normal man.",throwaway181919192,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12cata1/i_feel_like_i_deserve_to_die_for_the_damage_i/

My highs don’t feel high anymore. 
My lows feel lower than ever.
I’m addicted to masturbation &amp; cigarettes.
I drink excessively sometimes to escape.
I hate myself, I hate this body I’m in.
I hate the mistakes I’ve made &amp; the life I live.

I don’t want things to get better.

Why don’t I get to choose if I live or die?

I have no reason to be alive. No motivation.
I could change that. I don’t want to.
I wish I didn’t have to die to be dead.

My family won’t help me and the help that they will give is things I’ve already tried before that I can’t do again. And their response is well if you don’t do this specifically, then figure it out. There’s no where for me to go, I don’t have enough money to leave and even if I did I wouldn’t be able to sustain living expenses in this country. So I’m pretty certain about doing this tomorrow. I’ve had it planned for a long time and I guess right now is a perfect opportunity. So tomorrow I’m going to drive somewhere and take a shit ton of meds I stocked up with hard liquor. I’m so glad it will be over.",therealghost0,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12bw50p/im_going_to_try_to_kill_myself_tomorrow/
Damn the world knows how to knock a man down,"I'm so near the end. I nearly had the courage to end everything the other night but I failed.

I have 2 kids, 3rd on the way and a wife. I'd be leaving it all behind. I used to care about that and it felt like a protective factor for me but that is gone. I can't go on living for others, ever my kids.

The universe has been chewing me up lately. I had a kind of cardiac episode and passed out while driving, crashed my car. No serious injuries but too bad I wasn't going faster and it could have just done the job for me. I feel such disappointment around having lived. Then a few days later I randomly fall and fracture both my arms. My whole body is in pain, I can't sleep and I have no drive to even eat.

To top it all off I just lost out on an amazing job I've been interviewing for for months. After the recruiter, VP, and CTO all said I was getting it. I don't even have the strength to be angry about it.

To D and A, I am sorry for not hanging out with you both more when you offered multiple times, and for being a bad friend. To M… I am sorry that I have become a heavy burden and you do not want to deal with me anymore, I am sorry for hurting you so many times with my weakness and mental health, I can never forgive myself for what I have done. I wish I could rewind all those times we spent together and fix my mistakes as a person so that I could’ve appreciated you more, but I messed up. And to A… I only started getting to know you just recently and it has been a nice experience being able to support and talk to you. To be honest, I am catching feelings for you but I know it’s wrong at this moment and you deserve better after all you’ve been through. I wish I could say I would be there for you in the future, but at this point it might not even happen. I am sorry I cannot make you that promise.. To everyone else, I hope I was able to serve you all to the best of my abilities. But I think it’s best if I set myself free, so I cannot burden you all anymore.

Unfair world..the older I bet the more life it’s sucking out of me,"I’m going to be 24 in 3 months and I’m stressed. 
I’m not happy with where I’m at in life rn, I have very high expectations of myself and I know I’m doing this to myself, I really can’t help it.

This world is just cruel.
I’m still unable to speak up for myself at my big fucking age and don’t like confrontation. Prices for everything keep going up which a normal 9-5 job won’t be able to keep up with the prices. Work force is unfair, I’ve currently got a good job but I won’t be staying there forever. 
I’m not even sure what I want out of this life.
Moving out is also very stressful.
It just feels like once I move out of my family home, I’m just going to be paying a lot of bills, all my money will be gone and I will just be depressed. Housing options are really shit in london UK. I don’t think I can stay living with family for long as I do not get along with someone who’s part of my family. I’m not even close to family and I do wish I had a normal sister I could speak to literally about everything. I do feel alone and isolated. I miss having a bf, but I can’t really like anyone like that and if i do end up liking someone so much, they fuck me over.

I don't know,"I'm not really sure how to deal with this, or what to say. I've been at an all time low the past few weeks to the point where death doesn't really scare me anymore.  I've thought about different ways to do it, but never in a way that would harm someone else I think. I feel alone even when I live with family but they just don't understand what mental damage I've gone through my while life. 

My parents are a bit on the older side and don't believe in mental health problems, they don't know how to give good advice other than everyone goes through things and you have to ""keep pushing"". I tried therapy, told her how I felt and she secretly called the paramedics on me and had a fire rescue lock me in the therapy room and stand in front of the door until emts arrived and I felt trapped, a little betrayed by my therapist as well. 

The fire rescue guy stood there and asked me several times if I have diabetes (I have gained weight this year because of depression and eating habits/not feeling like doing anything is worth it even daily chores) which made me feel even worse, like he was judging me for my weight and made me feel so uncomfortable. And then I just got reminded how judgemental people are and felt even worse about myself in the end. 

In the end, I feel numb now. Like nothing will get better, nothing has gotten better. I have no one to talk to really, I'm alone in this. I know there must be people who have it so much worse than I do, and I feel bad for feeling the way I do. But am I ok for feeling this way? Am I overreacting?

The only thing currently stopping myself from kms is the thought of knowing what it would do to my younger sister…. but I also don’t know what else to do to manage life as it is,"I know so many people on here have had it worse than me and i work with mental health patients everyday so you’d think I’d be able to have a better handle of this but I can’t seem to and it just is getting worse. My depression and anxiety began a long time ago when growing up in a toxic household and then when i developed a chronic condition at age 11, along with my best friend and mother dying when i was 14 from cancer. The emotional abuse got worse until I just became so alone and reclusive. I eventually thought going to college, meeting my future partner, and just escaping my toxic household would be the answer. I graduated with a masters and have a decent job in a decent field but due to my trauma and cost of living i struggle with abandonment issues and thus cannot be alone, nor have i ever been truly alone as an adult. I have been unfulfilled in my career choice so currently I am trying to go back to school as well. I have a lot of debt too from school and will have more in the future if i make it that far. Cue a lot of bad decisions later and being shit and pushing people away and well here I am almost 29 years old and my partner of 6 years, whom at one point was my fiance is leaving me. I dont have a lot of money saved and could probs barely afford to live alone with my healthcare costs among everything else. Also just a couple years ago I had my first ever huge mental breakdown and was housebound for a year. With a lot of therapy, and support from my partner i got out of it to the point at least that i am now at and working but i am just as depressed and anxious as ever and nothing is helping. I dont cope with things like i used to and my fiance leaving me due to my poor choices has been the final breaking point. My therapist left for a new job and everyone in my area doesnt take insurance so forget about that. Meds arent really an option anymore as i am super sensitive to them as they make me worse. I dont have a lot of friends anymore and really no family. I can forget about kids probs now as ill be single and my clock is ticking. My health conditions are worsening and i just dont see how things are going to get better since they have only been getting worse. I talk to people but noone really understands or cares. I know once i am forced to move out of my ex partners house ill be doomed and most likely barely getting by. Doing any little thing with depression is hard enough and i worry about so much. So much of me just wants the pain to end but i also dont really want to die. I am currently researching how to die by helium sobbing away. I think about my 21 year old sister though and how if i kms she would be so much worse off as she also has severe depression and anxiety and besides friends and my dad(whom is toxic)she wouldn’t have anyone else. I struggle with trying to stay alive for her though and even for myself. i am just so very exhausted and scared… i dont want to get out of bed, i dont want to eat, and nothing seems to matter.

I want cancer

I only listen to rap music. Gangster shit. When I'm with other people and music comes on? It makes me feel again. Like the rap is numbing me up and distracting me. Talking about being a thug, getting high, girls, cars, money. I don't remember how bad life is when Kevin gates is reminding me I'm a drug dealing piece of shit and tells me it's a good thing to be proud of. I sell fentanyl for a living. I'm homeless. I'm trying to get out of it all but I might just eat my own products before I obtain enough money to get life in track.

7 years now. 7 years I've sold drugs and committed crimes. I've even worked for the police and FBI. Not because i got in trouble. Because I'm a piece of shit and I wanted to. They paid me cash. It wasn't about the money. It was about putting people I don't like in prison. Then once they were all in prison, it was just about being a piece of shit. Because I can. Upon reflection though, it's left me nowhere.

The cartel robbed me and left me broke and on the street and now I'm crawling my way back to the top. Nobody knows I turned informant, but I'm not doing it anymore after being robbed.

My wife is a whore. Married for 1 year TODAY. Haven't seen her in 6 months. She's a drug addict and a cheater. I didn't want her to leave but now I'm ready for her to be officially legally gone forever.

But more than being back on top being an invincible gangster who knows all the police's inner workings and avoids ever getting caught. More than having my wife and a happy life,  or removing her from it forever and becoming a stronger person not letting her continue to mustreat me. More than anything else what I would love.

Is cancer. 

A slow death. Everyone pity me. Feel bad.  Come see me one last time. Pretend everything is ok. Have love again and sit on a hospital bed for a week with tubes in my arm. Crumble away. Then let everyone else move on.

I never forgot that comment. Nine years later I was graduating community college with my associates degree in psychology; I was even given the Outstanding Student in Psychology award. I felt good about the direction of my life and my goal to be a counselor myself. My mother discouraged me from that career because she didn’t see “what good it did”.

Fast forward to tonight. During a fight with my boyfriend of nearly four years, he made the same remark I heard from her all those years ago. It felt like confirmation that I am unfixable. After all these years, the people closest to me have apparently seen no significant growth.

In my opinion, my counselor has been nothing but helpful. We are doing Lifespan Integration Therapy right now for my trauma.

On today's episode of Why I'd Be Better Off Dead™!,"Life just isn't for people like me. I have zero redeeming qualities and would be doing the world a favour by not wasting any more of its precious oxygen.

A lot of your success in life depends on what you were born with, and unfortunately, I was not blessed in that department. I'm hilariously short, especially for a male, and so ugly people flinch when they see me. I live in a very wealthy country, but am lower class, meaning I get zero of the benefits that come with that. To top it all off, I was raised in a narcissistic 'family' and was a complete outcast throughout my life.

I only have one goal in life - have a comfortable standard of living. It can't be that hard, right? Wrong. My parents emigrated here from a country then emerging from the brutal fall of communism - they remember days when there was absolutely nothing in the fridge. Obviously, that makes it hard to build any sort of wealth or prosperity for yourself. All of our upbringings were shaped by struggle and circumstances working against us. I was homeless at the age of ten. Yes, ten. Even though I have a roof over my head now, that's still not guaranteed, because this country hates renters and anyone without generational wealth.

Moving onto my social life, or lack thereof, rather. I was never exactly the talk of the town - I've been bullied from my earliest years for many reasons, too many to list here. I was always the one picked last in PE, the one with no partner in group activities, you name it. Secondary school is only marginally better - while I'm not bullied any more per se, I'm still completely ignored. Wealth gap aside, my friends (acquaintances?) never invite me to hang out, even when I'm right in front of them. My input in conversations is completely ignored, and it feels like they only tolerate me out of pity and obligation. As soon as better people come around, it's like I never existed.

And don't even get me started on love. Like I said at the start, I'm extremely ugly. I've been told I look like a serial killer, a rapist, a creep, all that. Because I stand so low in life, I truly believe that I'm incapable of romantic love. It barely even hurts any more. I used to want to start a family and give them a warm, loving upbringing and good chance in life unlike mine, but I realised that was a ridiculous fantasy. Even if I looked like a Greek god, I'm still too fucked up to even think about relationships and inflicting myself onto someone.

If you thought home would be a sweet relief from this shitshow, you thought wrong. I come from a narcissistic, over-religious family - that should tell you everything. In case it didn't, though, here's the gist of it: I was beat routinely until I was 12. Everything I did and didn't do was a personal attack against my parents, and I'd listen to tirades about how much of a burden I was. That kind of died down after I opened up about this to someone, but only because that shattered their perfect little image.

And with that ends another episode of why scumbags like me shouldn't exist. If you brought yourself to read this far, thank you so much. It means the world to me, and I love you.

I FUCKING HATE SPRING,"Holy shit I thought winter was bad because it makes me lonely and it's so fucking cold and there's nobody to hug and share warmth 

but spring is the worst. It makes me remember the warmth of the past and things that will never be the same again 

NONE OF IT MATTERS

I'm so glad I'm finally losing my shit. I hate being lucid so much. I hate having my shit together. I hate pretending to be normal and I hate how great I am at it. I just want someone to hold me like I matter 

But it's sprung time now and my body feels so free and warm despite the loneliness. It makes me miss the cold, when I could focus on the little pins and needles. I could go into my blanket and feel cozy 

Now I'll lay in bed, perfect temperature and nothing to comfort me. I wish I could rip all the skin off my body so it'd be in constant pain and I wouldn't have to think anymore. If I wasn't such a bitch I'd set myself on fire 

and I want someone to come burn their hands off trying to save me because they love me so much

PTSD triggered can’t take it anymore.,"Last year a man broke into my house and pulled me out of the shower to rape and strangle me. He is in jail now, but I’m now diagnosed PTSD, but it’s rarely affected me beyond daily nightmares. 

Recently my roommate’s boyfriend’s car was airtagged(essentially a tracked) and it got the location information of the apartment we were moving our stuff out from all the way to our new house. They tried to look for it and it was somewhere on his car. They then drove the car to see if it would change locations, but either it fell off or broke or was somehow deactivated. 

That sent me into a spree of thoughts and shaking. I felt that sense of doom i felt a year ago when I was attacked. I haven’t been feeling safe at all, lack of sleep, scared for my life. It makes me wonder what is the point of living if I feel like a stranger will end it instead of me. Its like I get these thoughts to die because I want control over my own life, which is ironic(?) we have an extremely protective aggressive german shepherd and a screamy border collie.

"My dog died, and I don’t know how to deal.","My puppy of 16 years died two weeks ago tomorrow. He was a wonderful dog that deserved so much better. We grew up together, and as I got to a teen, I couldn’t be bothered to spend as much time with him as I should have. His stuff got moved to the garage three days after he died, and I noticed his collar just lay on the floor in front of the garage door. Someone must have dropped it. I broke down crying, and I think that just set me off. 

See, I’ve had severe depression for about four years now—extreme suicidal thoughts. I take antidepressants. Was in therapy but quit it because it was just not for me. I go through periods of severe depression where I can’t be arsed to remove myself from my mattress to being super energetic as if I’m capable of anything. My dog dying just triggered that depressive side of me, and I’ve been considering suicide since then. I won’t kill myself. I’ve tried to a couple of times, the most recent attempt being in October, which landed me in the hospital with a subsequent visit to the psych ward. I know I shouldn’t kill myself, but I feel hopeless. I have no passion for anything. No motivation. No drive to finish this semester, my last semester of high school, mind you, with a bang! No motivation for college. Or a job. I would rather rot in bed for 20 hours a day and hopefully not wake up the next. 

Maybe I’m using my dog’s passing as an excuse for being such a slob. Can’t keep my room clean. Grades are sharply declining. Haven’t talked to another kid my age since December. Can’t even brush my teeth on a semi-consistent basis. Just in this in-between on whether I want to live or die. 

I’m not proud of myself. I’m disgusting. But what upsets me the most is how I couldn’t look at him—my dog—after he had passed. I’ve only visited his grave once, and it’s right outside my bedroom window. I sometimes wished I had died instead of him. He was a good boy—the best one.

I have wasted my entire opportunity to be young,"I just turned 24, I know most people would still consider that ""young"", but I have done absolutely nothing with my life. I have never had a real girlfriend, I have never gone out with friends... I barely even have any friends other than a couple of guys at my shitty retail job. 

I want to be 19 again for the rest of my life. I don't want to get older I am not ready to have actual responsibilities. I don't want my fucking family to get old and die before my eyes I just want to freeze time and live in limbo for eternity. But it's physically impossible. I still FEEL like I am a teenager but I am halfway through my 20s. I haven't been a teen for almost half a decade. 

Everyone I know from school have careers, relationships, and actual futures. I want to get a girlfriend who loves me and go travelling and just be happy and stay young forever. Life is seriously fucking unfair. I hate having fucking social anxiety and I hate not being normal. I wish I would just want to go out with friends and meet someone.

I feel like trash. Sometimes I wonder why I don’t end it all.,"An idle mind got the best of me and I stumbled upon these pictures of the picture perfect wedding of a former best friend of mine (we “broke up” bc she treated me like shit, long story short). Of course my ex was there with his perfect new gf in tow, who is everything that I failed to be to him and as a person in general. 

My wedding on the other hand was a dramatic nightmare that was postponed three times because of covid. 

So I guess This all has to be the universe telling me I’m a screwed up human being and I should just give up.

I’m just tired,"I’m 25 with two beautiful daughters and a wife who loves me but I wake up everyday struggling to move forward with my next breath. I pray for death to find me in a way that’s painless because even in my state of wanting my existence wiped away I’m too much of a coward to take my own life. I don’t care what happens to me and the only reason I haven’t gone through with anything is my children, whatever pain they might feel by me leaving them this way is the only thing that keeps me moving. I feel worthless. I am worthless. No matter what happens in a 24 hour period I think of how much better everyone around me would be if I wasn’t here anymore. I failed in my career and can no longer turn back to it. I failed as a father because I struggle to make the right parenting choices whenever I’m faced with an obstacle as a father. My wife tells me she loves me but I see in her face that she resents me more and more everyday that passes. I had hopes of becoming someone my parents could be proud of but I know I’m just a disappointment to them compared to my brother. I’m the older brother too and I know my brother is ashamed to be related to a loser like myself. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m at my breaking point and death seems to be my only escape.

Life (venting),"First of all, I wanna thank to those concerned strangers that have sent aid to me through messages and requests, it’s valuable but pointless. Please refrain from doing that.

I’m an old loser, even though I haven’t reached 40 yet and am years from doing so, I am a failure. In every sense of the word. 

I hate my life, I have always hated my life. I tried to be happy and be somewhat of a functional human as I was required. But the truth is I am garbage, or not even garbage cos you can re purpose garbage and give it a new use. I’m scum, I’m shit and I hate myself so so so much. What’s worse is that, I have to pretend everything is fine. Nothing bothers me, truth is, everything does and I feel so so so much pain in my body and in my heart and in my soul it’s just unbearable.

I try, believe me I do. I’ve done everything in the book. I have a strict diet, I excersise, I have weekly group therapy sessions and also individual, I take my meds. I go to church, I volunteer, I’ve worked my ass off for all my life. I don’t harm myself, I know the repercussions if people saw my wounds so I just don’t do it, while my soul desperately seeks for hurting me and seeing blood.

You would think I “have everything together” and am so strong and collected but the truth is, I’m a mess inside, I’m hurting so so much, I cannot explain the pain I have inside. 

I’m so alone, there’s no point in reaching out, I’m old and people have their own lives. I can’t expect for anyone to care for me. If I don’t wake up tomorrow, it would be the best day ever. I want to die so so bad. 

My family would be relieved and friends…I don’t have friends. I’m completely alone. I have set instructions and my will and everything that has to be done to my body. My body is so gross and disgusting, I’m so broken that I really think there’s no hope for me really. 

My failed attempts have taught me what I have to do in order to succeed this time. Every day, every day I think about death and how I wish so badly to give life to people that really need it and want it. Me? I’m a waste of space and air. I’m a parasite and everything I touch turns to death.

I’m the person you point at and say “oh, remember, you must not turn into THAT”. I’m “that”, a diagnosis, a loser, a wasteful human, something that needs to be destroyed as soon as possible. 

I don’t know how long I can play the part but, I know I will self destruct. It’s a question of time. To make it quick and clean and set all my affairs in order. I have done half of it, now it’s the lack of bravery or really the silly hope that “things will get better”, “just hang in there”…
There’s no hope for someone like me. Everyone will be better off without me. Stage 1 is done which is isolating and making people believe I’m fine. Now it’s just matter of time. And this time, there will be NO mistakes.

This post is meaningless and is just venting, shouting into a void how much I hate myself and want to die. 

Poison, cutting? Who knows, but there’s no room for mistakes. 
Is there a higher power? A powerful light that loves us all no matter what? Shall we endure this pain without relief? I pray every night for my death, every moment in the road. Ever since I was very very little. 

There’s no hope, I’m a ticking time bomb, and nobody knows. I will die that’s a certainty but happiness is something impossible. 

When it’s done I will write here again. Thank you. Please kill me in my sleep. Thank you. This existence has been pointless and also this confession.

Sincerely,

A sad loser",iamnothing1234,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12bweet/life_venting/

Just here to share my story,"I’m 23 years old and will highly probably be ending it soon.. I just wanted to share my feelings and my experience.

I joined the military at 16 and was extremely active (running 6-8km EOD and cycling 5-10km+ daily) being active was my lifestyle. I loved hiking and all things just physically involved. I joined the infantry at 16 and life was good. I passed my trade course and basic and was fully qualified just days before I turned 18. I was happy. I was proud. A year later at 19 I developed a severe knee pain out of nowhere (to the point I could hardly stand on it for more than 30-45 seconds without having to take weight off) I did Physio for 3/4 of a year and pain injections and they didn’t help. Doctors decided to do an explorative arthroscopy. It was done &amp; I was unlucky enough to have complications with hyper scar tissue formation in my knee and needed a 2nd one a year later.

This is when my life has took a turn for the worst. That was 3 years ago and I’m almost 24 now. My knee has progressively been deteriorating over the past 3 years to the point I basically cannot walk, I can’t put weight on my leg/ change directions &amp; every step has become a nightmare. I told the doctors my mental health was at a point where I didn’t want to be here because they were telling me it was all pain and I said pain wasn’t just causing this. I went through every single hoop over the past 3 years proving somethings wrong &amp; how bad it’s affecting me and my mental health… I had a PRP injection 6 months ago that cost me $1200 just to prove it wasn’t pain and that Dr I had told I was struggling to the point I don’t want to be here. He said I needed to get a psych evaluation because my response wasn’t normal which I agreed to do even though I know I do not have any mood disorders/ mental health issues that are out of wack other than this causing severe agony for me physically and mentally. I had an assessment done and came back as having nothing &amp; went to the ER telling them I’m in the red and I need the dr to listen (I said I need a knee replacement or amputate my leg I don’t care at this point) I need something done because I physically cannot keep doing this much longer. I went to my surgeons Physio giy and told him everything and he has collected all my notes from all the doctors I have seen and made me go in for a 2 psych evaluation to understand how it’s impacting me and my mental health better to help prove I’m not mental and I’m struggling due to how bad this has gotten.

I’m waiting on an answer but thus far doesn’t sound promising like they’re willing to do anything and my life is entirely crushed.. I’m basically incapable to function to any capacity as it prevents me from doing pretty much everything and they’re not even willing to do a TKR or amputate my leg (I have proof of moderate arthritis developed since my last MRI from a year ago I had one done recently)

I’m just ready to give up I truly feel beyond crushed and I’m starting to become numb and disassociate. I don’t want to hurt anymore and I can just “deal with it” I’ve advocated how bad it’s impacting me and I just don’t have it in me much longer

I just wanted to talk about it as it’s honestly destroyed me mentally and physically. I had everything going for me. I was smart and extremely physically fit and now I just want it to be over I’ve lost my career, my ability to do everything I love, my ability to do things with friends / family and now basically function on a daily basis. I can’t keep this up it’s too much. I pray none of you go through what I have been and I hope nothing brings you to the point you’re ready to end it all because it’s truly the most awful feeling. I could do I tonight and not hesitate for a second but I’m holding onto then0.001% chance they’ll help me. 

Anyways that’s my story, I don’t suspect I will get what I need and I suspect I’m going to cave soon, I appreciate u all for taking the time to read this.

I’ve sought help in every possible avenue and nobody has been able to help the answer seems clear now. I can’t keep living like this it’s truly awful",RubberDucki007,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12brm6h/just_here_to_share_my_story/
I'm supposed to be gone.,"All I wanted for the last year - all I *needed* - was that if I can't be bothered to actually live my life (and I clearly can't) then the best thing I could do is stop living this stupid horrific half-life and pull it together long enough to finally kill myself. This is all I want, all I've ever wanted, all I ever *will* want, and it's time I stop treading water and just fucking do it. 

The only thing that kept me going as I very quickly unravelled was that this was it, I would finally pull it all together enough to kill myself and finally get off the roller coaster. I was going to do it at Christmas as a present for myself but I pushed it back to not ruin the holidays for other folks; then at my birthday for the same reason, but again I pushed it back because a friend's wife's birthday is right around then and I didn't want to create bad associations for that time of year for him. There's no good time to kill yourself, but I finally settled on April 1st. This was it, if I could do *one thing* right in what's left of my miserable life, it was pull myself together long enough to tie up my loose endd and kill myself before everything gets so much worse and complicated in summer. It was time.

Well,.clearly I'm still here, and I'm devastated. It turns out I was too sick and too cowardly to take charge of my life long enough to die with some measure of dignity; like the rest of my life I just spiraled until I shut down, unable to do a goddamn thing but waste away. It's why I've never made an attempt before, my nervous system just collapses and I get lost in my own head. It's taken me several attempts to write this because I keep getting so overwhelmed I fall in and out of consciousness.

This was all I had. Now it's only going to get worse, and I don't even have the comfort of an exit strategy. The future is just a horrific, painful nightmare and I can't do anything about it.

I was told my thoughts aren't just regular depression and instead suicidal ideations,"I was talking with a therapist, and I told him about how I think about wanting to escape, and just love while time is frozen, or just live in this world as a ghost, and apparently those aren't normal. I'm so tired, this world is shit. I have these thoughts almost daily, I hate the monotony of life, unemployment doesn't help, no one wants a suicidal mess, no one gets back to me, if i was homeless i probably would have killed myself by now. But I was gifted the luxuries of having my basic animalistic needs taken care of. No meaningful family, some freinds, man living the life right? Everything is pain, and what's not is escapism, life is one of the two, just depends on the situation. I'm stuck in this purgatory, can't live, can't bring myself to die, just am, and that's the worst kinda am there is. If I died and this is eternal punishment I wouldn't be shocked. How else would you make the eternal torment last, make the person think they can live with it. Live with the shit thrown at them forever. Cause that's all life is, trying to live with all the suit thrown at you. I've planned out my suicide multiple times.

Can't afford to rent while looking for work/ freelance opportunities,"Circumstances have led to me not having a job or savings and being in debt with terrible credit. 

I already live in the cheapest housing available but I just started doing freelance art work full time but haven't been able to earn enough to keep everything running. 

The bank returned my rent check again this month as I don't have an overdraft and it's the second time in a row. 

I had so many things I wanted to do with my life but nothing is getting me anywhere and no one seems to care enough to help me. So, before I can be put into the dirt any further by my abusive and neglectful family, I am going to kill myself, or at least try to today. 

The shame and embarrassment of owning nothing, having no post-secondary education, no employment prospects and no support or belief from anyone in my abilities, I think this is evidence enough that my life is a complete failure. 

It isn't even about the couple of hundred dollars I'm short on rent or the fact that I'm starving or that no one wants to see me flourish, it's the fact that for so long I believed that I was actually worth something and could contribute to the world.

i'm not even sure if the ones i have are enough, nor if they're strong enough to do anything. i know nothing about medicine, i just take whatever i'm given

Going to kill myself if I dont pass,"(Posting this again because i lost pass to throwaway acc)

So here I am. Never thought I would actually start typing here. I had always scroll in this subreddit looking at threads that I can relate with.  I have been feeling depressed all year long and I have never felt this away before. I am in college right now in a course I fucking hate. In a school I fucking loathe to the core. But I made a few good friends here, only a few. It helped me get through the year. I also joined an org,  fuck I cant face them like this. But recently, I have been failing my one major subject, I retook it again for the second semester, and seeing my midterm grade, I still could not pass the cutoff. I dont think im gonna reach the cutoff for my final grade. ACTUALLY ITS EVEN LOWER THAN BEFORE. My classmates are going to advance before me, it does not feel I can hang out with them any longer. Holy fucking shit I have never felt this way before entering college. I should have chosen my own course, my own school, everything. Now Im too deep in to this. I promised my parents I would pass, and I dont know what to tell them. They understood the first time I failed that it was a hard course, and they were ok with me no passing it. But shit, I can feel their disappointment with me. I dont know what to tell them this timeUnlike my sister who is graduating law school, Im just here, drifting around. I just want to disappear. I might end it all once I get my final grade. It would probably better.im sorry for the long thread i just wanted to get it all out. Just need to prepare for a painless way.

How am I supposed to want to live when even my mother doesn't care if I'm alive or not.

Thinking about death brings me peace,"Recently dying has been on my mind. I think about how I would do it and what it would feel like. These thoughts play on my mind constantly. The idea of losing consciousness and never waking up seems so peaceful to me and thinking about this almost brings me joy. When I think about death everything seems so pointless and I realise the act of living means nothing. Thinking like this makes me want to do less and I often sit alone with my thoughts. It’s a vicious cycle. I tell myself to hold on and that I will feel better soon, but I feel like this so regularly that I don’t want to hold on anymore.

I just wanna post my shitty attempt.,"This happened a few months ago. I was too much of a coward to do it at the right time and ended up falling asleep. When I woke up it was already 5 am. The bridge was quite far from my home so I decided to do it now. But when I reached the bridge it was already too late. There were many people and if I jumped everyone would see and I would be rescued. And I couldn't return home because my mom probably found I was missing, how could I explain anything to her? I decided to be homeless for a day and come back at night.

I walked far. Nearly 15 kilometres. Nothing but rich people's houses, rich kids on expensive bikes, churches. I couldn't find a place to hide. I couldn't find the ocean even though that was close to me. All of the roads lead to different places and no 2 roads lead to the place I wanted to go to. After something like 7 hours someone recognised me and handed me to the police.

I remember who you are. You think you saved a life but you only made it worse. I spend everyday thinking about my failed attempt and how pathetic it was. All you have done is make me stick around for a few years until I am able to leave my family and then I will kill myself. I will get through college but i won't start a family like you said I would. I will not understand my mother like you said I would. I hate both of my parents.

Depressed or pretending?,"I want to start of by saying that i for some reason can’t post and ask on mental health and I don’t care enough to ask why honestly so pls don’t mind me asking here…
So basically I have this thing that I can’t explain and it’s driving me nuts. I could feel my worst and be just about to kill myself and then switch feel my best as if I have never struggled with my mental health and then a day or days later and feel my absolute worst again. Now you might ask why I don’t talk to a therapist about this, well.. what stopping me is when I’m at my worst times I don’t want to talk to anyone literally no one and when I’m doing great I don’t feel like I could be believed by anyone about my problems because in said moment I’m doing great maybe I just imagined all of this yk? Even tho I know that after every good time comes a bad time and some told me I sound bipolar I really don’t agree with that because from what I have heard those episodes both are much longer whereas whatever tf I have Switches whenever it wants…I could also just be suicidal for a day and feel great for a week then bad for weeks and great for just a few days it’s so random and draining and I don’t think these good and bad times are normal because it’s not that I’m sad at bad times I’m full on suicidal doing not great things and what’s usually stopping me from ending everything is the big possibility that I would fail and how big that would impact my already miserable life.

Decided/accountability/imposter syndrome,"I have decided to make a separate account. I want to post but have two friends who technically have a small chance of seeing it, where currently on my main they'd see I comment here a lot but have never posted.

I want to post without them knowing. Maybe I don't want them to worry. But I also think I don't want them to see it so that I can be more sure of my intentions. It is not to alarm or cry out for help or cause concern. I have done all of those things before, and I'm tired of fucking around. I don't like feeling like a fraud.

I am making a secret account so I can at least be real with myself, and I can still put myself out there 🤣

I enjoy writing. I feel so alone. I feel so alone. I just want to talk about this. Not for the karma. Not even for the connection, though I do think that's part of it. My main reason is accountability. And to give my inner reality credence in the outside world.

Here is what I came here to say: I believe I will kill myself. There is a lot else to say about that, but for now I just wanted to say that I'm pretty sure it's going to happen. I don't know when. Don't know how long I will wait. But I think this is the end I want. This has never made more sense to me. I am trying to embrace it. I will kill myself someday. I'm 30. I do not want to be old when it happens. I'm 30. I'm going to kill myself.

Maybe next year I will say I'm 31, I'm going to kill myself.

"A reason to live, is there any?","I'm not too old. Not young or old. And I've had my fair share of trauma, abandonment, but nothing that has driven me to suicidal thoughts or such. The real thing that has been making me want to do it is simple - Life is not forever, the Earth turns and damages, repairs, and even itself will crumble away in the near future. I've had a phobia of death before, but now - the thought of everything disappearing doesn't scare me, it makes me numb. There is nothing and nobody in this world that excite me so much that it's worth living. My body is rotting away, I'm expected to make big decisions in the near future, nobody necessarily depends on me (though I have a loving family and friends) and I personally feel like I'm a mind looking through a zombie-like body that does decisions for itself. I'm just sitting and waiting for it to end. I have a few things I don't want to lose, but it won't matter to me if I'm dead. Is there any solid good reason to live?

Am i suicidal for the wrong reasons?,"I don’t even think i suffer from depression or anything. I was diagnosed with reactive depression but idk. I just hate being alive.

nearly every day i say “i can’t do this anymore” and then the next morning i wake up and do it again.,"i’m not going to hurt myself but since i lost my job, i think about it so often. it’s not just about money, it’s about independence, connecting to people my age (30 yo) etc. i already feel broken having cptsd and my whole life has gotten exponentially more triggering. i’m single and struggling to find work and relate to people my age now and it makes me feel like a massive failure. even though i’m not on a marriage or kids timeline, i feel like i’m going nowhere.

as i understand i think about this because i want a way out and it’s comforting in some way. but i feel guilty. i had a bad night the other night and in the morning found out a twitter acquaintance bf unalive. i felt guilty to have even let the thought cross my mind seeing what it’s done to other people.

my friend just lost a friend randomly to asthma this week. it’s hard to be there for her when i’m trying not to lose it all myself.

i say i’m depressed and people don’t take it seriously because i never attempted and they see me “high functioning.” my friends don’t seem that concerned. some of them act like i’m just being negative. there are good things in my life but i feel guilty for how even the good things feel empty. it’s been hard to do any of my hobbies.

I just found out that I have been blocked by a former classmate who I thought was a friend,I have been allowed to follow them before but on Sunday they went private and removed me as a follower. They never followed me back and when I searched for them their name didn't appear which means that I've been blocked by someone who was friendly and kind in person but not kind and friendly to me on Instagram which is shady and toxic. I feel suicidal because I think that I'm just a person that gets blocked out because my mental illness is not understood and known about which is why I only view and like posts and not comment or direct message. I am seen as a fake and suspicious account and person and or maybe a robot just because I don't say anything. I feel suicidal because I can't explain this to anyone because I won't get help and I would only be told to just move on.

It’s scary getting closer to the end,"When I was 9 I made a plan to kill myself before I had to start taking responsibility for my life, I was always told that 'these are the best years of your life!' And that I won’t have many friend’s after leaving school and shit, so I figured 'im already not having that much fun so why bother if it only gets worse?' And that’s been my mindset for the past almost 8 years. I’ll have all the fun I can now and when shit starts to get serious I’ll give up, now that time is getting closer and closer and I get more and more terrified each day, the final year of school I basically dropped out (my attendance dropped below 40%) my grades were shit (already shit to begin with but they just got worse) and I stopped talking to my friends (haven’t spoken to anyone in real life in over 9 months). Sometimes I think about how I shouldn’t have cut myself off from everything at the time, and how if I just applied for 6th form then maybe I’d still have a social life, and I wouldn’t spend every fucking day just rotting in my bedroom. I have no job, no education, no money, no friends, no motivation to change any of that. If I just wasn’t a lazy coward I wouldn’t have to die soon, but no. I sabotaged myself and I can’t be fucking bothered to fix it if it even can be. So soon probably in a couple months I will be dead because I gave up on myself and am too broken to fix myself. And y’know I couldn’t even enjoy the time I had when I planned all of this because I was always thinking about how it wasn’t gonna last.

Really going through a rough time.,"Hey. I feel really really guilty about something and it makes me feel extremely guilty and suicidal. Long story short my ex (each others first love) of 3 years broke up with me feb 19. It was college long distance.  She said she wants us to remain friends and basically strung me along for a month as such until she came back home for spring break. We still had each others locations. She told me when she was coming back on spring break and that if she isn’t busy we can hang out. Then she completely turned around and said actually we can see each other in June.  And I told her I’d be in town with my aunt, you know just to plant that seed that I’ll be around.(who I actually was with)  I timed it so that when she came home I’d coincidentally be walking past her building. I saw her, as she was walking and she didn’t see me. I called her from across the street but she didn’t hear me because she had headphones in so I made my way across and just before she went inside I tapped her and startled her. I apologized profusely for scaring her. She said it’s ok and that she can’t hang out but she’ll talk to me some other time. I said ok and asked politely if I could hug. She smiled and laughed and  hugged me and went upstairs. I texted her after and said I’m extremely sorry for scaring you and asked if she was ok. She said she is ok , but later texted me and said she didn’t like me coming up behind her and that from the outside someone could’ve seen it as me following. She said I could’ve texted her but coming up behind her was really weird. I was freaking out at this point and poured my heart out and said I’m extremely extremely sorry. I told her you can turn off your location so that you feel comfortable, which she later did.  She said I’m not gonna say it’s fine bc it wasn’t but I appreciate you acknowledging it wasn’t ok. and when I told her I wasn’t trying to creep up on her she said yeah I get that now. She said she doesn’t see a reason to dwell on it and that it’s over and she doesn’t really care about it. And that she doesn’t have a reason to block me and that there’s no bad blood or anything. But I still feel horrible. Truly. I definitely wasn’t trying to follow her , in my mind I just had wanted to chat for a bit. I feel horrible about this. And the fact that we’re done. Absolutely horrible. I know it sounds isnignificant to an outsider but I feel like a horrible horrible person. I made mistakes in our relationship but what made me feel better was knowing that we were still together. This was a major mistake I made and to her it feels like I’m a stranger. I feel like a horrible creep for what I did, and I had no intentions on scaring her. Please tell me it gets better I really feel like shit right now. For some reason my brain cannot accept that she reassured me that it’s over. My brain keeps on overthinking and refusing to accept that it is over and that she is going to text me randomly saying “yeah I don’t forgive you for that, you’re a creep.” I honestly just wanted to catch up with her after being strung along for a month. She never once told me I was bothering her by texting her and so I was really strung along and desperate for closure and answers.  I feel horrible.

"Life is a sequence of perpetual burdens, and in two months I’ll be free.","I will kill myself in two months, one week, five days, and two hours from now. It will be my eighteenth birthday, which means I become independent, which means I’m no longer bound to what family I have left, which means I can tie up loose ends and pay back their hospitality and make it seem like I’m simply ready to be an adult, which means they’ll remember me as kind, I hope, which means if I die they may feel it harder, but not as hard as if I were a bad person, which means I can move on, which means I will have the freedom of choice, 
which means I will choose to kill myself. 

What else is there? When the only adversity and pain I know is the simplicity of life and the emptiness of living, then where is the hope? I’m tired of living; I’m diseased with life. The only respite, the only cure, is the only thing other than life: death. 

Two months, and I will find a clean place and sunder it. Perhaps a forest with trees glistening from morning dew. Birds flittering in the sky like small clouds, like low soaring stars in the midst of day. The song of crickets, of squirrels and dragonflies and that silent hum that flowers make even though we know no noise comes from them, still we strain to hear their small petals twist against the wind. And in that quiet, that snapshot, that picturesque moment of nature and what it means to live and simply be—there I will kill myself. I will take a gun and let my brains interrupt the flower’s tune and the birds flight. My blood will stain the grass, the trees, the morning dew will be red and the red will look out of place amidst the green and nature will see the disturbance and see my corpse and…And I suppose it will simply let me be. 

I will kill myself. But before then I’ll vent and rant and ramble to strangers who perhaps know my pain or something worse, because the cruelty of living is only relating to those you’ll never know.

How was it so easy for them to forget me?,"I tried killing myself in June. The security guard at the building I was trying to jump from caught me and took me to the cops. After nearly 5 hours of the hospital trying, only one friend came to pick me up from the hospital.

He has called only thrice since then. None of my family, friends or colleagues who knew about this have reached out to me. Only my uncle reached out to me to tell me that my father is embarrassed by what I did and has told me to not call them back. I hadn't spoken to them for a year prior anyways.

The ease with which everyone has cut me off makes me wonder if my problems can be solved, but the only person I talk to, my therapist has agreed that I'm better off without these people. She however has said that she can only help me with coping with the feelings, she can neither see the solution nor solve my problems. I agree.

But why, after a lifetime, do I not have anyone to trust? I don't care if they don't like me, but why must I fight everyone to earn my dignity to live?

Why do people call s*icide a coward’s way out?,"I’ve been wondering this for a very long time. Admittedly I’m a bit biased because my biggest fear is dying but nevertheless suicide is a permanent decision and I’d think most people would agree it’s scary and sad. Nobody knows what happens when we die, it’s all a huge mystery, for most people it’s a scary thought. I don’t see anything cowardly about making a permeant, literally life-changing decision that takes straight into you into the unknown that is death. Nobody knows if what’s on the other side (assuming there is an other side) is better or worse then life so plunging into the unknown by ending your life is in my eyes a very brave thing to do since you could just end up somewhere much worse. Even if you have strong beliefs that there is a positive outcome waiting for you on the other side, Heaven or otherwise, regardless of how strong your beliefs are what you believe in isn’t guaranteed to be true. The thought of death terrifies me and for someone to speed up the process and rush into it makes me feel a mixture of horror, shock, and to some extent even being impressed that someone could pull of something so foolish yet so brave. I believe life is valuable and shouldn’t be intentionally cut short and as someone who is scared of death the thought of someone being willing to cut their life short requires a lot of courage.",KatTheFelinoid,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12bekmv/why_do_people_call_sicide_a_cowards_way_out/

My story is really just like any others, had abusive parents and sibling who would beat me up, got abused physically, mentally, and emotionally in school as well. It was bullying like in those movies basically except in movies the bullies get punished the one who got bullied gets help, and i didn't. It was hellish, and the worst part is that i couldn't do anything about it and had to endure it all for years. I'm gay, and in my country i am despised by all just for existing. I did try to be fit in, adhering to societal norms and expectations from me, hoping maybe the world would be kinder if i did, and in the process, losing bits and pieces of myself, and it's something i still regret doing today. Unfortunately even with that, the world didn't lighten up one bit, it all just became worse. 

The only reason i live right now is because i am too afraid to commit suicide. I keep thinking of how painful it must be and how worse my life would be if i failed. And because the truth is that i really don't wanna die, but it feels like there's no other way. 

And because my heart keeps on hoping that maybe if i live just for one more day, i'll see my own wish come true. Which is, to have someone who will love me for who i am, and make me feel deserving of it when the world told me i wasn't. 
My dream, my reason for living is fragile and shallow but it kept me going. I'm 20 now, about to be 21 soon, and i started interacting with other people, hoping to find him. Well, it didn't turn out great, i apparently am too weird for not fitting in with the gay stereotypes. I didn't have the stereotypical twink body or muscled body, i also was told i was weird for clothing like a guy but having very feminine traits and qualities. 

For some this might not mean much but it made me lose all hope on the one thing that keeps me going. Because this is who i really am, and to be told that because i don't fit stereotypes that i won't get anywhere, made me feel like the world just told me to go fuck myself and that i'm an idiot for even hoping for something as nice as that. 

It also made my self-hate much worse than before. My friends keep telling me i have positive traits and whatnot but the truth is i can't even see them. I hate myself for being like this, for looking like this, for just existing the way i do.
They also keep telling me that self love is important if i wanna find ""him"" but the truth is that i don't even know how to. 

This just made me feel hopeless about the future and where my life is headed uncertain. All i ever wanted was to love someone, and be loved. I wanted to give him hugs and kisses, i want to be there with him, and for him. I wanted to experience cuddling with him in bed specially on cold nights. But unfortunately, maybe he just, doesn't exist. Maybe i'm just waiting around for no one. Because i've been waiting for him for a decade, and he never showed up.

Even as of writing, i want to die, but i still foolishly have my heart hoping and clinging to my dream. I want to give up already but a part of me still doesn't. Maybe if there was a way to kill myself peacefully and painlessly, it wouldn't matter all that much anymore because i would be able to do it. But i don't know how do i do it painlessly. 

I don't wanna continue anymore, so please at least maybe you can all help me find a way to die painlessly, it's the only thing i want now. Thank you",vivi_love,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12bqa4o/i_wish_to_die/
Fuck everyone,"I thought I would be helping a friend with his business idea. But after the way he talked to me yesterday I can’t help him. He bragged that he made more money that he ver did in his whole life which gave his inflated ego that he’s bad at hiding even more inflated. I didn’t feel like hanging out and doing work at the same time so I stayed at my work after hours for some peace and quiet and to help him with his project. He wanted me to come over another friends house where he was. When I got there my friends new girl friend was there and he was there. They then proceeded to make it my job to entertain her like I just fucking met this person and I really don’t care to do shit to make anyone smile. I don’t know cause she was there or what not but they were acting like they’ve never been around a woman before. I left as soon as I came. I need to be alone. They made it look like something is wrong with me. Like here we invited you how dare you leave, you keep acting like this. (Live when they say that). And earlier that day my boss gave me a talk on how I’m not doing my job properly and how I’m holding the company back. And today I got a ticket. I’m really done with this I really do not want to feel anything. Saturday I drove to a parking lot and got as high as I could possibly could just to be numb. The same understanding I try to give to others is a fucking problem when I ask just for a little of it.

I need to get it out of my chest,"I really, really despise having to be alive. I hate this world, hate myself, hate everything that comes and goes. I did most I can do to improve my life since I was an addict to either alcohol and any kind of substances that let me ease the feeling of deep rooted depair. My life was fucked up, had a pedo-friend who molested people I knew and I trusted him, he committed suicide. He was one person who made my life better since my parents never took care of me neither they had much money. I essentially lived by my own when I was at the age of 13, they were having difficult times between themselves (due to an affair). My granpa died (never cared a single but, he was awful to me, my aunt and I have never precieved anything good in him). Then I was sent to live with my grandma to live 'with her', but since she was gone all the time because of alcoholic uncle was not as fucked up when she was around - she was staying with them for 3/4 of a week. Had ofc toxic relationships, and then I got into drugs and alcohol abuse. Not I am 132 days fully clean, I got a job that doesnt require me to break my back. My parents are better, father that I was fighting with during his alcoholic 'mishabs' when he was aggressive towards my mother is also not drinking almost at all.

I (16f) am going to kill myself in 2 hours,"I'm just so exhausted. I've been struggling with depression, suicidal thoughts and self harm for almost 4 years. My school assignments have been piling up lately and I have no idea what the hell I want to do with my future. I have no friends and social anxiety that makes it difficult to interact with people. I've seen a few therapists but things didn't get better. It doesn't help that my mother (single parent) is super religious and doesn't believe in anti-depressants. She literally told me not to tell my therapists things about our family and that the only thing I'll need in life is God. I'm atheist but I have to pretend to pray and believe in God everyday cause if I don't, I'll be disowned.

I showed my self harm scars to my counsellor at school and she told my mother it would be better to take me to the mental health hospital. The judgey looks I received from my mother and sister were too much for me to bear + the hospital took away everything on me and took my phone. The silence + overthinking was torture so I pretended to be fine and came back.

The only reason I've held on for this long was that I didn't want to traumatize my younger brother (14).  But I can't do this anymore. I'm just so fucking exhausted of everything. My body hearts so much. I can't get up in the morning. I go to sleep every night wishing I won't wake up in the morning. I want it stop. I want everything to just stop.

I'm so fucking exhausted, why can't you see that mom. I'm not your 'strong' child that is going to make it through just like she always has. I shouldn't have to be. Your going to wake up tomorrow to find my cold, dead body. I wonder if it would matter to you in that moment that I'm failing my classes, or that I don't do chores much, or that I've been not praying lately, or that I've been missing school.

I'm thinking about ending it soon.,If i seriously can't find a job after two months of looking constantly I'm just giving up slowly at this point. Being unemployed makes my depression so bad. No one wants to hire me I'm trying my best to get these jobs and it's never good enough. I never get the job and makes me hate myself even more. Everyone around me puts me down too. I don't know how much longer I can go on. Like i'm losing my mind at this point. Every day is the same. At least when I had a job everything felt more tolerable since I had income. Now everything feels like a struggle. I no longer find joy in activities I used to enjoy. I barely listen to music anymore and that was something that always made me feel better. I just don't know anymore.,spaceangelxx,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12bmsvf/im_thinking_about_ending_it_soon/
Counting the days until it's over,"I'm already a dead man walking so I can't be convinced unless there's a miracle but I just want to clear my conscience even if it's just a little with my story.
I have had it easy with my life so far, a life many would love to have, although things are going south with it in general. There's many reasons for me to keep going especially as it's for the sake of others but I just can't do it anymore.

I've never been clinically diagnosed with anything but I'm certain there is much wrong with me. One of those is possibly bipolar as some times and things can swing my mood quite quickly.

I've never been happy with myself even at a young age, my earliest time depressed would probably be as young as 8 - 10 where I wanted to die and tried to get others to strangle me, in particular my dad.

I'm introverted, I've never been able to make friends easily and I can never keep up with them. Even those that I could just message now I just can't bring myself to talk to others willingly.

Even when the love of my life was with me my mood would be all over the place, although to be honest she wasn't that much better. We'd been together for 8 years, supporting each other and getting through the times.
The toughest times being when she had betrayed my trust mentally and a little physically, at least a few times.

She didn't really get along too much with my family, getting into a few heated arguments.
Unfortunately everything in the end caused her to end up essentially locking herself in and ignored me a lot in preference for her online gaming friends, things grew a bit colder and distance.
I wasn't the best at helping her get out of the rut and I wasn't the best to her in this time.
Without me knowing at the time that she had betrayed my trust in her yet again especially during COVID.

Even before COVID she had basically refused to get herself a proper job, running away from the idea of writing a CV even with help as we were exiting COVID restrictions and was doing small under paid cash in hand work. Unfortunately COVID broke us down more and she grew a bit more distant.
I snapped after an very expensive avoidable accident and I did the thing I regret the most in my life, I didn't hit her but kind of came close to which even then I know makes me a terrible person.

After she left my health has been slowly declining with multiple problems over the years. Possibly a side affect of all the stress and pain on my body from both physical and mental drain.

We have been talking to each other a fair amount over the 3 years we've been apart. Initially it was supposed to be a break but out of my stupidity and emotions I overreacted and made things worse leading to a cycle of silence and ghosting which sometimes lasted months. I'd never dealt with anything like that before so I couldn't handle it and again end up making it worse each time.

We did have a lot of fun together still during our time apart, even going on a small holiday together with friends who I've now ghosted myself. Even spending a bit of time together like when we were together, these moments never lasted long however.

I helped her with her CV eventually as she was being pushed by her parents for a job. Initially she was happy with the job and after getting a management position, slowly over a year grew to hate it. We didn't meet up as much and ended up talking less as time went on because of work stress for the both of us and because I'm an utter contemptible idiot again making things worse and overthinking everything.
It eventually ended up with a complete and proper breakup.

The only reason I kept going throughout that entire time was the most slim of chances that we'd be back together properly. I nearly end myself multiple times, the closest was buying a rope and tying a hangman's knot. I tested it out and it works well and was 1 or 2 days from ending it until she flipped my mood by talking to me.

I've never been good at talking to her about my feelings and letting her know how much I really love her. So much so that I've had to learn to write everything down for her as I can't ever talk in person about my feelings.
The first couple long rants were received as well as it could be but over time she ghosted me on these as well. Even a life story she at one point wanted to hear wasn't received at all. I slowly gave up with this.

My family's health, mine and my dad's health especially took a massive downturn last year. My father being hospitalised at least 3 times in the last year with lung problems. Myself catching COVID which was painful and then no longer than 2 months after catching the worst flu in my life putting me in A&amp;E gasping for breath, barely able to hold myself up and feeling like death with a viral and bacterial infection. I've not fully recovered since and I'm only 28.
Most of this all happened pretty much at Christmas, my mum now permanently as my dad's carer and myself supporting the family.

Recently she injured her head at work and took time from work, during that we talked a lot but never met. She eventually quit her job shortly after returning.

I knew that she had for a long time wanted to go over to the US and she finally booked a flight to meet up her online friends. Deep down I knew it wasn't just that as I knew what shes like when it came to betraying me previously. I honestly don't have a clue what she even thinks of me or why she's even kept going along with me. Even though she's worried for me I still can't figure her thoughts on me out.

Of course during all this time I was supporting and helping her out. The amount of time, mental effort, money and love I put in, even if it still could be so much better wasn't enough.

My worst of fears came to reality when she said she thought there was another she's in love with, I tried to be good as I've gotten better at handling these emotions but I repeated the cycle just before she flew out.

In my last do or die act I decided on impulse to buy a forever rose, it was then or never again. I fucked up, I waited by the coach station and realising it too late that I went to the wrong one that was booked. I never saw her. Shes ghosted my last desperate and ranty messages. Soon she'll be over in the US later today and in the arms of another who I helped push together inadvertently, which hurts me especially since it'll be her birthday soon while she's over there.

I do have unhealthy attachments, however I can't move on and will always love her no matter what's happened.

All the things in my life, previously school having done it's toll on me, work stress, my weak aspirations and procrastination, physical and mental drain and the love of my life has lead me to end everything in 3 weeks with a bottle of vodka and a noose.

It probably would be earlier but I can't do it just yet, I need to get a few things in order and compete some personal and work tasks before I end my life. Even if I've not fully done everything I'll be doing it anyway.",NoRecord29,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12bms9f/counting_the_days_until_its_over/

I pushed, clawed and ran....he followed. Until one day, he couldn't anymore. Had it all ended there, perhaps I could have survived it, but he began to use his education (psych and social worker) to mentally fuck me for the last two years. Silence, ignoring, randomly begs for me to come have sex (another addition of mine) and then dismisses me, calls me crazy and psycho for not letting him go. Recently, he moved away. Didn't tell me where. I don't care to know. I finally thought I was free of at least the constant tears and hope and use and sadness. No. He returned and I could not and would not resist. Nothing more than sending vids to get him off and then silence again. Today is the anniversary of my father's death. I am not ok. I reached out, to no avail. I am alone, in the dark, floor is soaked with tears. I don't want to feel sorry for myself. I don't want to be an object to anyone. I just want someone to care. Someone to understand.

My wife is the only reason to keep going but now she's apathetic.,"My wife recently just hit her head on a door by accident but she's changed, she's usually very happy, sweet, kind, gentle, loving and emotional but now she's just completely apathetic all of a sudden and I hate it. 
She literally means the world to me and I'm fully dependent on her to keep living and I know that's unhealthy but there is literally no other reason I can think of to not kill myself, I don't care if people care about me and I don't care if there are good things in life that I should enjoy the only thing I care about is her happiness but she's a completely different person now. 
She says this has happened before where she would hit her head by accident and she'd be completely apathetic or aggressive to others and then she would go back to normal after a while but I'm so scared that if she doesn't go back to normal that I'll have nothing and everything I've ever feared will be real.

Everything is meaningless and I fail to create meaning,"I think it's the end of the road for me.

I've been diagnosed with a wallop of GAD and Depression since early teens. I was bullied throughout childhood and have little friends outside some niche circle that somehow think I'm worth sticking around for. I have no other relations outside them and my family since everyone either pays me no mind when I try to reach out or even outright insult me. I lack personality and humor because life gets too sad for me to ever laugh again. I'm a closet atheist in my majority religious community and had to recently break up with someone I love out of that divide. I will probably end up alone. I have not found people like that in my circle and probably wont and too tired and scared to try. I have failed socially and emotionally.

My academics are not as stellar as they used to be. Suddenly stuck in the ""not good enough but has potential"" phase, a poor B, second place. I win competitions and projects but it always fails some mark, threshold, goal I set. Good work leads to more work instead of less. People drop me once I'm no longer useful post-achievement. I feel shrivelled of all creativity and thinking now tires me out instead of stimulates me. Trying something new, learning something else no longer tethers me to wanting to live because I can't feel satisfied doing it. So I have even failed professionally and in my passions.

I know people will tell me to take it ""one more day"" but if the days dont change even when I do, and Ive been at it for years with therapy, whats the point? 

Life has no meaning and people will tell me there is freedom to create meaning, but what if you even fail at creating - something that supposedly everyone can do? 

I feel I have no place in this world even though I really wanted to. Sorry, I did try.

I am grateful to the people I have met in passing and those who stayed in my life but I don't think it's working anymore.

I just wanted someone to hear my voice one more time. Thanks.",fowapax,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12bjfow/everything_is_meaningless_and_i_fail_to_create/
HELP!!! Please talk me down!!!,"I’m really close to doing something very very stupid to myself I’m desperate right now I need help

My long term partner has mental health problems like me, he tried to kill himself this morning. I stopped him. He blames me and his mum for everything that’s wrong with him and that I’m the reason he wants to kill himself. He won’t get help he thinks he doesn’t need it. 

He is literally all I have. I have no family and my few friends are at uni in another country. My parents were abusive in many ways, my mum was physically, emotionally, and mentally abusive, my dad was a liar who pretended to be there for me but just abandoned me when I needed him, I haven’t seen or spoken to any blood relatives in years. I have nothing but my partner I don’t care about anything but him but even he tells me how I’m a burden and ruin peoples lives. He tells me how I’m the reason he’s not further in life.

I’m a person who enjoys the happy moments of life. This is what aches me most. I appreciate these moments but I just can’t handle the idea of existence. I know it might seem a little confusing but really, those random very little moments aren’t worth the pain of existing. I’m not looking forward for anything and I don’t have a goal that would make me to stick around. I’m trying my best and I try to live by the book (I’m engaged, I work on my career, exercise). And non of that is stopping me from the daily feeling of wanting to give up because it’s really all dull. 

I think about ending my life a lot but I haven’t done anything towards that yet. I keep searching for ways, I try to find tools that would help me end my life. I find that comforting, it’s the same level of comfort self harm used to make me feel when I was a teenager. It’s a relief to know that at least I have the option to not exist.

I'm tired of having to fight.,"I(mtf 20) was occasionally suicidal since I was 13 years old and since I was 17 I wanted to kill myself every day.

I medically transitioned when I was 19 and I thought that the nightmare would end but I experienced paradoxical remasculinization of my face on hrt to the point where I can never pass without ffs.

It's been 3 years and I'm so tired of fighting. The only thing that I'm living for is the chance to get ffs which will make me beautiful again and allow me to pass without makeup

I bought a rope and nearly hung myself off a bridge but my mom promised me that she will help pay for my ffs (how much help will hepend on her finances) and that was enough to stop me from doing it that day

(My dad will put 13k toward my srs but not ffs because he says my face is fine which I don't fucking agree with. He will never understand that my face is disgustingly masculine and that I will never pass without surgery. He will have to live with the guilt of not having done more to save me when I'm gone. 

It's so hard being misgendered by co workers and my boss every day and having to hide my true self from them. This was never supposed  to happen because I would've passed with 1 year on hrt if my doctor didn't mishandle my care which caused my body to masculinize despite feminizing hrt.

This was supposed to be a new leaf in my life, a chance to begin again but that day will never come until I get ffs and the thought of living a lie and being miserable for what could be the next 3-5 years makes me want to rope and end my journey here.

It's been 3 years don't I deserve a break from all this? I know that my parents will be miserable when I'm gone but they can have my pain for all I care. I'm too exhausted to live for anyone else any more.

The only reason I'm not dead is that I'm a coward and that I will always chicken out. My brain would rather cling onto some bullshit unrealistic hope than accept the truth that I've lost.

I'm probably not gonna kill myself for now but the thought that somone else could kill me at any day is comforting. I would be at peace with my own death knowing I did my best but it was  never enough. I would be a mom and a real woman in heaven if that place ever exists and I can stop suffering and rest.",AndyGoodw1n,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12bi4gc/im_tired_of_having_to_fight/

My brother needs help and I don't know what to do,"This is my first reddit post as I made a reddit account because I really need help and I don't know what to do. My brother is 15 and him and I have always been pretty close. When I was his age, I went through serious depression and attempted to un-alive myself multiple times (I never told anyone and no one found out). At the time, our parents didn't even believe depression was a real thing, so they way they handled it was shaming me and taking away all the things I loved until I finally brought my grades up. My brother is going through the same thing now, except much worse. Now, my parents think depression is a real thing so they found him a therapist and are kind and understanding to him. However, he is not getting better. He's started cutting himself, which is horrible to see. Especially when I have to clean up the blood he left in the bathroom (makes me gag and almost want to throw up). He is on meds, but he says they aren't helping. His only hobby is the gym and he doesn't even want to go now. He won't do anything with the family, even though he complains we don't want to spend time with him. He has a ""friend"" at school who is even more suicidal than him. We believe she is filling his head with ideas of self harm (we don't know where else he would have heard it from) and of suicide itself. And personally, I think they have a suicide pact together. People have been telling me as the one closest to him I need to do something. I work all day, but I do try to get him to go to the gym with me, but he never seems interested in doing anything else with me. I know this is how depression makes you feel as I went through it too, but I also know it makes it worse. I feel like there is nothing I can do. And now his therapist is saying she can't help him, but we can't afford a psychiatrist. Please help me, I don't want to lose my brother, he is my best friend.

All I want is a peaceful death,"Title says it all.

I've tried to overdose already, but every time was painful and long. Worst part: I never even got to die.

It's laughable that I can't even die without suffering. All I want to do is escape all the pain that I'm in, and every time I try to, I'm reprimanded and left with dismissive comments.

My last attempt, the staff at the hospital kept saying how ""lucky"" it was that I was stopped. Lucky for who? It's not lucky to go back home and lay paralyzed in bed hating every breath I take. Or spend nights crying and writhing in pain and calling crisis lines every other hour. 

I knew full well how slow and painful a death by OD would be. I chose it because I didn't have any other options. Living is just as bad. It's torture. At least I'd have a chance at putting it to an end with an OD.

Instead, I'm funelled back to therapy that I can't afford and medication I can't afford.

This week might be my last,"In all honesty I feel like this week might be my last today. Lotta things happen that I legally can’t talk about at the current moment, but after all of that, I went to intensive outpatient therapy and it was fine. I’m connecting more with these two new guys and I feel like we might be friends. I even plan to do something this week with one of them. but in all honesty, I really hope Something Happens and I don’t get to hang out not because I hate him or I just want to not be around him. I just hope you end up not doing anything this week just so that way I can commit suicide so much has happened for the past 14 years I’ve been alive and I know a lot of people are going to comment saying things either like “you’re 14 what could’ve you possibly have been through” or maybe even some thing like “you’re 14 You have so much to live for” but in all honesty, I don’t this is like the fifth or sixth time that I’ve lost everyone of my life and not even in the scenario of death just in the scenario that I have to be alive, knowing that I messed it all up. Sometimes I wish I could talk about more what’s going on more recently without legally getting in trouble or even just talk to somebody about everything that’s happened but I know that won’t end well and I feel bad pushing my problems on the people and then dying and them, knowing that there’s nothing that they could’ve done, and possibly putting them in the same suicidal guilt that I am in but I just don’t wanna be here anymore every single day I just fuck up my life more and more nothing ever gets better and it never will and when stuff gets so stressful that you snap all the sudden, you’re a monster, I am a monster I am nothing, put some depressed, anxiety, ridden, psychotic autistic, mentally ill bitch I don’t have any good qualities or have any good features anytime I do some thing to look in the mirror I can just hear peoples voices in my head telling me every little flower that I’m doing how stupid I am how useless I am I look in the mirror and all I can hear peoples voices telling me how ugly I am out in perfect I am how fat I am I realize that I have nobody and then I’m completely by myself. No one will ever actually understand me I’m just the person that you want to stick in a mental hospital and hope that fix them when in reality last time I was sent to a mental hospital, it just borderline traumatized me I have lotta regrets in my life which I know sounds crazy considering that I’m 14 because it’s just like why is a 14 year old regretting so many things in their life and the answer is it’s just because I’m some stupid fucking mistake I mean I was an accident child I wasn’t even meant to be here I mean, my mom should’ve just aborted me, especially considering the fact that I almost killed her while she was pregnant with me even before I was alive, I was ruining peoples lives even when I was born despite me being black, and Hispanic, I was white as a ghost, and apparently that causes drama between my family, because not even my own dad thought I was his kid that was a fun thing to learn and then regret in my life there’s so much I wanna say here, but I don’t want this to be one of those post right spill out my entire life story and then I get dogs together and sent to a mental hospital and then have to delete another Reddit account but sometimes I just wonder how much better with my life be if I just never existed or maybe if I was born beautiful, born without trauma born without drama before I say, this don’t get me wrong I’m appreciative and very glad with the type of and heritage I have inherited, but sometimes I wish I was those blonde hair, blue-eyed, white people with the perfect life and the perfect boyfriend or girlfriend with the perfect family with perfect parents with perfect siblings with perfect friends I look at people like that and I just wish that was me. Because I don’t know what I did to God to upset him so much for him to fuck me up like this my old friends would tell me that I was one of God’s toughest angels, and he gave me one of his toughest battles because he knew I was strong, but I think that was bullshit. I’m not one of God’s toughest angels, and he knew that I’m convinced that he just wanted to fuck me over for being an accident child for being just a shitty person. And Being a shitty person to be around. I hate my life and I hate everything about it. So that’s why this week might be my last. This probably won’t be my last post.

human beings are fucking disgusting,"for context, i am a 17 year-old male.

i am so so so fucking sick of dealing with people and their constant spewing stream of bullshit. it just never fucking ends, like holy shit please shut the fuck up about your nonexistent problems. i understand we're not supposed to compare our lives to others because ""you never know what someone's going through"" but guess what, people fucking do it to me all the time so now it's my turn you fucking cocksuckers.

their issues are so fucking small they could be considered nonexistent. my peers seem like they would just LOVE to call themselves depressed and are looking for every fucking reason to say that their lives are worse than mine. fuck off and go to hell cocksucker, i don't give half a fuck that you had a long and tiring day at work, sorry not sorry. go ahead and cry to your mommy about it. meanwhile i'm trapped, completely alone, with full 100% guaranteed knowledge that i am COMPLETELY FUCKED FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE because God decided he was gonna cross some wires in my brain and make me autistic. (and don't try to convince me otherwise, because nobody experiences the world the way i do.)

these pieces of pure human shit who all deserve death are just SO adept at interacting with the other walking shitpiles. this allows them to do things that are crucial for happiness and success in this existence, such as making connections, experiencing love, and possessing confidence. none of these are things i will ever be able to achieve due to this piece of shit disorder, and i dare you to try to tell me otherwise because again, nobody has the foggiest idea of what it's like to be me.

no matter how hard i try, i simply cannot interact with human beings in the same way others can. it is completely and utterly impossible. people can talk all fucking day about ""well you can be happy on your own!"" or ""having a romantic partner isn't important!"" shut the fuck up shut the fuck up. just because something isn't important to you doesn't mean it isn't important to me. i don't know of a single fucking person who is more socially inept than me and that will haunt me for the rest of my fucking life. i am simply going to die alone, with no true friends or girlfriend by my side, because my confidence and social skills are so shit to where i just avoid everybody all the time. and of course this causes every person i have any interaction with to just assume that i'm either a piece of shit or don't like them because i avoid them. and how can i blame them? what else are they supposed to think? hence, hopelessness, because these issues are completely impossible for me to do anything about and i'm not going to let anybody lie to me and say that i can. i have completely ruined countless relationships, both romantic and not, all thanks to my autism and destroyed self-esteem.

so sorry motherfucker, but no, i don't have it easy, which is exactly what they always say to me whenever they have to bitch about how their job is boring, or their friend is mad at them, or their parents won't let them go out, or whatever stupid normal teenager problem they have. and hearing them talk about how easy i have it because i'm ""just a background character"" makes me just about ready to strangle them to death with my bare hands. you really think it's fun being the background character? the one who has absolutely no social life because he can never, ever, EVER, talk to anyone without making a complete ass of himself? you think it's easy? 

you wouldn't last a day in my shoes, bitch.

Thought Vomit,"Hello, Reddit. I am going to dump all my thoughts here. I have nowhere else to turn to. Even though I have ""people in my life,"" when I have reached out to them, I feel I am not taken seriously. Nothing gets better anyway when I share things, but at least over the internet I can just vomit it out without my thoughts getting in the way and messing me up. I might end up talking all over the place still, but that's fine with me. When this is finished I'll have let everything out.

Since money problems have now caught up to me, I've made the decision to stop eating fast food for that ""instant gratification"" reward. I need to save up money to pay off my student loans, my maxed out credit card, repair my vehicle, late bills... and food being a big part of what was keeping me afloat, it has now been a rough couple of weeks. The maxed out credit card is my fault alone. Nobody to blame but myself. I already know that, so this is just me reaping what I sowed. I will learn. This is what I get. 

I am behind on student loans because of my own decision to not pay them either. I would rather have a taste of something yummy from a restaurant or fast food to feel some kind of happiness in my situation, but in totality, it just worsened my circumstances. Now, instead of having my 1,825.00 to just pay off (since I brought my loan down to that) it has now increased to 4,000+. 

I also decided it was a good idea to stop working for a good while. I used PLUTO (Planned Unpaid Time Off) that my job issued out for employee's to use when I just did not feel like working. I obviously should not have. Now I had a paycheck half my pay and I could not afford to pay my half of the bills as agreed upon between my partner and I. I am not happy with what I do as a job, but it allows me the ability to work from home, because I am terrified of driving. Thus, when I am given the opportunity to work less, I will take it for sure. My job even encourages it with their messages they post! ""PLUTO is ending this month for a while, so use it while it is here!"" So I gladly use it, to be free just one extra day. I wish I could just literally auto-pilot my job and that would at least make it better. I am trying though. This week I only took off Sunday and will work the rest of my shift days fully. One day already down. I have to.

I've tried reaching out to therapists, mental institutions, psychologists.. to find out what is wrong with me. I have felt like there is something wrong with me for 4 years now. I've noticed I don't get things like others do sometimes, and I feel like I get dragged through the mud because of it. When I have certain discussions with my partner, it just feels like basic conversations to me, but to him he gets frustrated with me for ""not understanding"" what he is saying, but I truly believe I do understand! It's heart-breaking to see how angry he gets with me over conversations that I feel are so simple. I have always felt so stupid when talking to him sometimes. 

If it's not conversations, it's behaviors I do that has ended up him calling me dramatic or too sensitive. I cannot stand heat. It makes me sick if I get too much of it and I need to leave. Showering is the main issue. I remember showering with him one time and the water was so hot I eventually had to leave because I felt super sick. He told me that I was being dramatic and comments like,  ""Are you serious??"" It just made me super sad. I was not lying. I ended up just laying on the floor in the bedroom on my towel and cried as he continued to shower.

I self-harm again and that has subsided my thoughts, but I don't know how much longer I can deal with constantly feeling like something is wrong with me, I'm stupid, I want to die and all the other negative thoughts in-between. My job says they care about mental health much more than other professions and they have all these programs and phone numbers to call, but because I am terrified of speaking on the phone, I do not do it. I have to do it enough 8hrs a day at my job. When I did try calling places to get mental help, all I got was transferred around and eventually hung up. With each quick two words from someone being spoken and then a transfer I felt more and more nervous and like I was making a mistake. 

I can't even take advantage of my job's mental health benefits, because I have to wait a year before I can use it again - I've already used it last year for other things... so sometime near the end of April is when I think I can look into it again.

In the end, I at least want all this to be out there. I couldn't tell my mother how much in-debt I am. I don't feel she would help me, she has her own problems to handle and I made this decision to move out on my own. I feel she would just silent judge me or be angry with me outright. I could not ask for help money-wise or mental health-wise. I should be able to take care of it all myself. It is my responsibility and my fault for even being in this mess in the first place. I think one day I will eventually kill myself because how worse it has gotten, but not today at least. My work was never this affected before. I hope I eventually cannot handle it anymore and do end it. I am still too afraid of dying, so I have to just wait. I think I finally have an idea of how I want to die though. I just hope when I do it, it ends it. I don't want to come back physically damaged.",tentatat,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12b8l3y/thought_vomit/
I Feel Trapped In Having To Live,"I got some pretty bad news today and I feel like it's just the straw that broke the camels back. I honestly don't think I've ever been happy, I wish I was never born everyday and when I wake up I'm upset. Some days are better than others but now that everything I worked towards is gone, I can't do it again. I keep praying for something bad to just happen to me but I'm getting impatient.

I feel trapped because of the damage that suicide does to a family and I don't want to break my mom's heart anymore than I already have, hurt my friends, abandon my dog plus I don't wanna scar anyone who finds me. I wrote a suicide note to my loved ones. I've done this in the past and went to a quite place where I read them and then burned them. It was somewhat therapeutic.

If guns were as accessible to us Canadians as they are to the American's I have a strong feeling I would have shot myself years ago.

i’m gonna kms soon,"i’m only a freshman in highschool but i’m dead set on killing myself soon. maybe over the summer or something. i’m thinking overdose on sleeping pills but i’ve heard that they’re a little unreliable now. i really just wanna fall asleep and never ever wake up

i have no reason to live. i hate waking up everyday. i hate breathing. i hate doing anything and everyone. no one would care. i hate my family, specifically my dad and brother. my friends probably wouldn’t care about my death after a few weeks.

the main reason i want to is that i physically can’t stand my dad. he constantly belittles me on the smallest things and makes me feel horrible. earlier this year, i had a high B in my AP world history class and my dad screamed at me and told me to get it up and said that i just simply need to try harder and get better. today, while i was driving (i’ve only been driving since about january), he started yelling at me because i missed a turn and then when i started freaking out because he was yelling he just started yelling more and i just can’t really take it. i cant stand being in the same room as him. every time he’s with my mom (they’re divorced) he ALWAYS brings up my messy (depression) room and will say stuff like “it’s disgusting. everything in that room is so fucking gross” and that’s just indirectly f calling me disgusting. he screams at me for the smallest things and makes me feel so insignificant that i don’t think he’d even care if i died. he admits to gaslighting and manipulating me. he says stuff like “if you don’t give you kid a little trauma then what’s the point?” well you succeeded. you really succeeded in your goal

i am completely unlovable so it’s not like people will be extremely upset if i died. i’m so outcasted at school that i only talk to 2 people on a daily. people in my theatre class don’t even try to talk to me. every time we pair up in gym class, i never have a partner. there’s this one girl from another school who actively ruins my life by spreading rumors to any friends i manage to make and causing them to block me and ghost me.

how do I tell someone I’m suicidal,"hi, 15m living with my dad and little brother.

in the shower about 10 minutes ago I realized I’m suicidal, I don’t wanna live anymore and there’s a hundred different things all at once that I’m dealing with.

I don’t wanna kill myself but at the same time I want to, I don’t wanna continue living my shit-hole of a life but I also really wanna live.

it’s such a fucking difficult situation cause I genuinely don’t think it would change anything for anyone if I did Jill myself but I also don’t wanna make my family go through trauma and shit because of me.

I’m too much of a coward to actually kill myself but these thoughts and feelings will eventually become too much to handle and I’m scared and I don’t know what I am capable of doing.

I don’t know how to tell someone, I don’t have any friends and I don’t wanna tell my psychiatrist cause she would probably act weird about it, everyone would.

I can’t call suicide hotlines because I’ve got phone anxiety and I don’t like my voice and let’s be honest they would probably not even answer.

Wanna go back to normal.," I wish i could forget about it all, i wish i could go back to when i was a normal kid. I wish i could bury it all again. 

Why did she do this to me, why was is she so cruel? Why do i still love her. Everytime i made a mistake i was hit, even now, as a 16 year old. It's like a childhood memory at This point, looping and looping. Nostalgic memories i treasure, even though looking back i feel scared and sad. I'm getting in even more trouble now. Cause after I got hit yesterday I'm. I'm still shaking and fearing her. 
I'm still thinking about it I can't get it out of my head. Every thought is coming at once. I can't breathe i feel like I'm going to pass out. Why. Why is life like this. can't look in the mirror, I'm such a mess. My heart's pounding so fast. Anytime i hear her voice, i can't say anything it's like I'm frozen. Watching everything i do. Even having access to my emails, she can see any of my posts, and use them against me. 

It's my fault really, fucking up is my specialty. Can't do anything without being told to, i even manage to mess that up. I'm a jobless good for nothing mistake that shouldn't have been born. Maybe if i kill myself I'll be reincarnated as a person that's less stupid.

No one would care if a insignificant worm killed himself. All i do is limit this world anyway, take up it's resource, space and drag it down to hell with me. Then everyone could get on with everything that's important. They wouldn't have to tell me what my every move should be.  Waste of time , waste of everything.

I locked my door earlier, so it's not like anyone would find me for awhile. I need to calm down though, I'm still shaky. Don't want my hands flinging pills around my room.",hibsusbsbanaj,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12bawrd/wanna_go_back_to_normal/

Acne Has Ruined My Life and Its All Over,"In middle school I was covered with severe acne all over my face. No other kids were even at the point of puberty where they could form acne yet, but there I was looking disgusting. Funny thing was, I wasn't even growing. I looked like I was 10, was barely 5 feet tall, and could not understand why I had severe breakouts. Fast forward to freshman year of high school, I was getting bullied profusely for how bad my skin was. It ruined my self confidence, and I could barely leave the house. I looked for anyway out of having bad skin, so I made the excellent choice of grabbing some of my moms makeup. Now I had severe acne, and had cakey foundation all over my skin that didn't even come close to matching my skin tone. Obviously the bullying ramped up. I was now known as that disgusting acne boy who wore makeup. I heard comments about how bad I looked every single day. Thanks for letting me know guys! So I do what any desperate kid does with acne, I take Accutane for 6 months (keep in mind that yes I tried all of the other methods first and nothing worked). Accutane is the miracle acne drug promising to clear acne forever if you can put up with the side effects. This drug worked wonders for a couple of kids I knew, who went from having severe acne to never breaking out again (seriously the 4 kids I know who took it have not broken out since finishing their courses and all of them have been off of it for at least a year). Did it work for me? Fuck no. I did clear all of my pimples on this treatment, but my acne was so bad that I had severe scarring. My face was covered in flat red spots that looked just like acne. My parents, who were sick of hearing me complain all the time, wondered why I wasn't happy with my results. I told them to simply look at me, I was still absolutely disgusting, just with red scars instead of bumps. So time goes on and after a year, my red scars finally are almost faded. At this point I think I'm in the clear, all of my skin problems are behind me. Sike! It's almost like the timing was planned, because as soon as I became comfortable with my scars, my face broke out in severe acne again! So we are back to having zero confidence, back to hating myself, and back to hiding in my room all day. I try to tell my parents about how bad I'm struggling, but they are sick and tired of having to hear about me complain about my acne. So they try to force antidepressants down me and throw me into therapy. Funny enough, the therapist couldn't clear the red blemishes that covered my whole face, so I was still insecure and upset after months of trying. So I go back on Accutane for round 2! This time, my face doesn't even clear on the medicine. I swear to god, after 6 months, I was still breaking out pretty frequently. The dermatologist decided that I was on it long enough and just pulls me off. It's almost like I needed more time on Accutane, because within a month of quitting my severe acne is all back! I cry to my parents of course, who just get mad at me and tell me to accept my acne and move on. So that's exactly what I do. I find a simple skin care routine, and just man the fuck up. Honestly, the simple skin care routine kind of worked for a little while, and my skin alternated between looking pretty decent (which for me was 3 or fewer big pimples) to looking meh (5 or 6 big pimples) for about 6 months. Then, I lose control of my skin again. So it's back to the dermatologist and back for another round of Accutane, which my mom informs me will be my last course. I go on for about 2 months, before my stomach starts to have issues and I am forced to come off of it. Great. I actually had a pretty good break though, because my skin managed to clear in those 2 months, and the results actually stayed for another 3 months. So for 4-5 months, I had the skin I always wanted. I would have no more then 1 or 2 pimples at a time, and life was fucking amazing. I do think it's kind of funny how having 1 or 2 pimples is what I always wanted when everyone else just has that naturally. These 4-5 months also happened to be the start of college. I made so many friends, had the confidence to start seeing girls, and honestly began to love myself and my life. However, you guessed it! My severe acne has been back again for the last 3 months. I thought I finally left acne behind in high school, but I was completely wrong. So that's the point I am at right now. I have absolutely no one to talk to about my skin because my parents will just yell at me and not understand. I can barely leave my dorm room because I'm so embarrassed about how I look. I'm skipping classes, not eating enough, and absolutely envy my roommate because he wakes up with clear skin every morning. I have a dermatologist appointment 2 days from now and Accutane is the only thing that has ever worked for me. The chances of my mom letting me take it are absolutely zero especially considering what happened last time. If I don't get prescribed Accutane, I am going to call it quits. I cannot suffer like this any longer. I have been hiding in the shadows watching life pass me by for the last 6 years, wasting away my entire high school experience and now college too. I've become so broken that I've given up on hygiene and skin care. For the last 5 years I have kept an extremely strict skin care routine, diet, sleep plan, workout routine, and done everything I possibly can to keep acne away. I have not eaten any processed food in 5 years. I have drank nothing but water for 5 years. I have not had any dairy or an ounce of sugar in 5 years. Now, I haven't even showered in 3 days, I know I'm going to look disgusting regardless so what's the point. I'm sick of having acne and having my life pass me by. I'm sick of seeing other people eat junk food and party and have clear skin. I'm sick of sitting in my room crying. I'm heading out if I don't get my next Accutane prescription. I deserve a break and I really want to rest. I'm just so tired.",Former-Guard4104,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12aswg1/acne_has_ruined_my_life_and_its_all_over/
Do I deserve this,"I am 18. I’ve been needing to get an evaluation for a while now and I did everything I was supposed to do. I attempted on March 19 and about 2 nights ago I relapsed (self-harm). I advocated for myself every time I felt like things were getting bad again and now I’m at another rock bottom but I guess the general consensus is that I’m supposed to pull myself out of it. No matter how many times I talk to my counselor, a social worker, my therapist, my mom, or anybody. My counselor and them recommended I get an evaluation multiple times spanning over the past 6 months and it can’t happen due to family concerns, and so i’ve just been a sitting duck the whole time.

Struggling to stay alive,"I am currently struggling to stay alive. Everything in my life fell apart at once. My whole life has been extremely hard. And every time it seems I am getting calm and peace in my life something happens to disrupt it. I am not the type of person to go out and cause drama for myself. It seems to find me. Mostly from my family members. To put it into perspective my childhood was full of sexual abuse, physical abuse, verbal abuse, etc. I was forced into a marriage as a teenager by my parents. Forced to have a child because I was pregnant at that time. I was a child bride and mother basically. The person I was forced to marry was abusive. I couldn’t leave until I was 18. I fell into another abusive relationship shortly after that because I did not know how to recognize signs of an unhealthy partner. 2 kids by 19. I didn’t get a childhood or young adult life. I worked hard to go to college, work on my career, etc. I gave my kids everything I didn’t have and did it 100% alone. My exes would surface every time things would be good. They would try to take me to court it just cause disruption or let my kids down. Fast forward to today… the ppl in my life don’t show me love. They use me and hurt me. My children are mean. Like cold hearted type of mean to me. And nice when they want money. Drama just finds its way into my life through my family member. I cannot leave bc one child is still at home with me. I want to die. Life has been too hard for too long. I’m almost 40 and I haven’t had a period of time to relax and be happy. It’s always a struggle. I’m in the verge of killing myself.

I wake up every day and want to die,"I’ve struggled with suicidal ideation for most of my life. I’ve self harmed in the past , I haven’t done anything in a while, but it gets harder to ignore the urge every day. Especially when I wake up, literally every day, knowing that literally everyone else in my life would be better off without me. My family, my pets, my co-workers - literally everyone. I know they'd all be better off without me ruining things for them. 

I feel like I'm nothing but a burden on everyone. I don't feel like I'm supposed to be happy or comfortable in my life. Like I majorly pissed off God or whichever cosmic being is running. Any time I start to relax and feel like I'm doing better, the rug is pulled out from under me. 

I'm tired. So, so tired. I'm tired of feeling like this and not seeing any other way out. I'm tired of being told, in so many words, that my feelings aren't valid or they're frustrating for others to deal with. I'm so tired of feeling less than because my brain wasn't made right. I'm tired of feeling alone. 

I don't really have anyone I can talk to about anything. I've unfortunately spent my entire life using self-deprecating humor to mask how bad things were. Which just made anything I ever said or tried to be serious about, seem like another joke. 

 I know I need help - know I want help. But this is the closest I've ever come to telling anyone - making, essentially an anonymous Reddit post with a throwaway account. I've been too scared to actually write a letter or make a plan or even reach out to a prevention line. It always felt like writing it down or voicing how I felt made it more real in some way. Like if I didn't, the feeling and thoughts weren't real or would go away. But they don't go away. Ever. Sure they get quiet, but they've been pretty damn loud for a long time now.

I kind of killed myself ten years ago.,"A few months ago I found a name for what I guess I had done, passive suicide. Wanting to die without having any intent to do so.  So we just shut down and wait for death to take us.

Growing up I never knew what I wanted to do with my life. It just started to come to a head towards the final two years of school where I had no skills, or preferences, or even a practical understanding of my capabilities. I was assigned a Special Needs Assistant for most of my school life, so even when I wanted to struggle to adapt, the system chose otherwise. I was mocked for it and played into it where I could. I started using the SNA to do less work. I started skipping school entirely. Somehow I kept managing to pass tests, but that didn't matter.

I dropped out of school at 16 and promised myself I would enjoy two years without struggle, then end it all when I was 18. But unfortunately it's 10 years later and I'm still here, living in my mothers house. Watching her grow older and more frail. Wondering when or how she will die and leave me alone in this world.

I can barely function. I don't go outside often. I survive of disability. Never got my drivers license. Never finished school. Ten years of hiding in my room and no memories to show for it. I doubt I will make it when she is gone.

A selfish part of me wants to kill myself before being abandoned. But I'm too weak. I can dream about dying, but I'll never have the conviction to take my own life.

I wonder how I will react when it happens? Will I feel numb? Or will I find a corner and crawl into it?

When my mother dies the house has to be split between me and my sister who has two kids. We're not family, there's too much pain and abuse there. The money I would get for my side of the house would barely get me enough for a terrible 1 bedroom apartment right now. But the housing crisis is only getting worse and costs are going up.

There is nothing for me. I guess I'm just waiting for death to take me, or what little I have.

I don't want to call myself a victim. There were a lot of conscious choices I have made. But sometimes it feels like I was created just flawed enough to drown in this overbearingly complicated world that feels too complex to even dip my toe into.

I am so lost and tired,"I’m 22 years old and failing in school. I called my parents today and cried for over an hour telling them that I can’t continue with school. They told me that I need to put in more effort of studying, but I can barely get out of bed in the morning. I have no idea what to do and think about killing myself constantly. 

In high school I always told myself I would kill myself by the time I turned 18 as a coping mechanism to calm myself down. Since then I think about killing myself to fall asleep as like a fucked up counting sheep kind of way. 

I think about being in free fall, shooting myself in the head, or hanging myself. I wish I was diagnosed with a terminal illness so I would have an excuse.

My parents are very good people and I feel terrible for the grief I’ve given them

abusive support system,"does anyone struggle with people who claim they love you but when you tell them that you are struggling they just flip it to you being “selfish” or “hurtful” for telling them how you feel? 

the people closest to me, the people I have always tried to make proud of me told me the following things today:
“What a waste”
“Move on” 
“It’s too late for you to be sad about… ” 
“We told you…” 
“Really, what you just want to give up?”
“Do you know we have had hard times” 

I can’t remember more right now but the jist is even tho I told them choking through tears that I had no hope or motivation for my future, that I wished I could just disappear and I was met with harshness, rejection, and anger. 

I have been numb for a while now so I didn’t really feel worse by their reaction but it makes me realize I don’t have to live for them. I don’t have to live for anyone anymore. I just wonder if anyone can relate. I don’t want to give in to the fear of failing at my future again but I need to be able to lean on people when I need help and maybe my family just will never be those people bc i was always that person for them.

i pressed a loaded gun to my temple,"(22) I am in the middle of the forest right now in complete pitch black darkness.  I came here to finally be at peace in my life from 24/7 torture of BPD, PTSD, MDD, etc.  I put my loaded glock pressed to my temple for at least 2 hours.  I am still very drunk rn which I thought would give me the courage to pull the trigger.  But my finger couldn’t do it.  

I am terrified, being literally completely alone in the middle of a national forest in complete darkness.  I started sobbing harder than I ever have.  But it was because I am devastated that I couldn’t do it.  A traintrack runs through this forest and  trains kept passing me as I layed low on the ground with the gun at my temple, shaking and crying.

Ramble (pt 5) envy,"I didn’t know I could be so envious. I just want what I don’t/can’t have, but only with the most mundane things. I’ve watched the people around me live and I envy them. They’re so human, and their humanity seems so right. It seems so normal. Their existence doesn’t drive them into a suicidal spiral. I guess I suppressed the ability to “want” for so long that it’s all flowing out in my final days. Envy and selfish desires. An insatiable craving for a life I’ll never have. 

I want those friends, I want those parents, I want those  car rides with friends while listening to music. I want to be able to laugh in a carefree way. I want a kiss hello and a hug goodbye. I want those all-night study session with your closest friends. I want to play video games and get angry and throw our remotes at each other.

I almost died at work in January and now I often wish I had died that day,"My social life pretty much derailed in August after getting exiled from my friend group. With that came huge waves of anxiety/depression. For the first few months after that I had been at a point where I was harming myself, having suicidal thoughts, and wishing things were different as the whole situation was extremely unfair. Come January, I accidentally slice my leg wide open with an angle grinder at work just barely missing my femoral artery. I bled a lot and was rushed to the hospital. I’ve recovered fine since then, but the mental repercussions started to hit harder than ever. I was still in a life where I’m actively hated on, have no close friends, and no one to talk to. Being stuck at home for weeks after my injury made me do a lot of thinking. No one really cares about me and nothing that happens to me matters to any of my old friends who I used to think had my back. I’m hesitant to end my own life for the sake of my family, but I cannot shake the possibility from my mind that I could’ve been dead, leading me to constantly feel like I’d rather just be dead.

I got myself in quite a situation,"Hey everyone,
I hope You have one of those better days.

Basically to make the story as short as possible: I have had suicidal thoughts since i was 15 (im 22 now). There have been better and worse times obviously but the need to just end it always prevailed. At 19 i got into a relationship with a girl of my dreams. Since i always struggled with the perception of my self worth and she's really  perfect in every way in my opinion i didn't think this will be a long relationship (also she has had lots of relationships before and she was always the one to end things so i just thought she would get bored quickly i guess) 

Well at some point there when she saw how strong my suicidal urges were and after she had several panic attacks about losing me I promised her that I will be there as long as she wants me. 
Just so you know it wasn't my way of blackmailing her into staying in a relationship with me. Again with my self image issues I just thought that it won't be that long until she just doesn't want me. And i was okay with that.
We have been together for three years now. I made the promise at around one year into the relationship. It has only gotten worse. It gets worse with every breath i take.

So now im in this predicament where on one hand everything is just fucking falling apart and I hate everything about life besides her. On the other hand I always cared about her more than i do about myself, so im just a walking shell now. Nothing brings me joy, im unable to get out of bed when It's not absolutely necessary to do so and i just try not to bother her with my pathetic presence.

I have a goodbye letter for her ready and i have had an attempt (recently) that she knows about.
I don't expect any of You to have a solution to any of that nonsense, but thank You very much for reading, and i truly hope You will all feel better soon.
Thanks again

"Suicide wont salvage me, but still","I hurt so many people, all who loved me or i loved them, even with my last act i will only cause pain, but i have to do it. I have no one to tell, no one should care about me. The world and humanity is not on a level yet that it could be beneficial to save someone like me, for any purpose. I didnt go trough much shit, i was just mentally weak, and altough i tried and seemed to get my shit together and be stronger, even fairly mild blows from life destroyed all this progress. A week ago, after months of taking pathetic, but at least real steps towards happiness, i could finally see the light at the end of the tunnel, but now i feel like the patchetic, undesirable, abnormal, hysterical piece of shit. Altough deep down i know i should not be doing this since i have my whole life ahead, and that i did not do anything really bad or unforgivable, let alone the fact i never had ill intenions, it does not matter. Intentions never mattered in this world. And at the end of the day, all my love could just be a selfish try to prove to myself i am a good person, and it may have only existed because i imagined a future in which i was happy with the ""loved"" other person- delusion. ALL FUCKING DELUSION. Unconditional love does not exist, not in this place. I read a long time ago (in the Bible, i guess... yeah i am prolly going to hell, i never fully embraced God the convencional way, i dont know shit about this whole stuff) that a man can donate all his money to the poor, do all the good things, but if he doesnt have a clean heart, he is not a good soul and will not get eternal life or whatever. Honestly i would not blame god for not letting me in paradise, i did nothing to deserve it. 

Since i was a kid, i wanted to do something heroic, important, meaningful. Now my life is in a situation where nothing spectacular happens around me, and i cant prove to people through my actions that i am not a fucking coward, that i worth something. And i dont wanna overreact little things to try and prove it, cuz its worse than just remaining silent. I want to save important people of mine from killing themselves, help them find greatness, make them just a tad bit more happy, find meaningful connections, brotherhood and all that is a NEED for humans.- My art kinda helps me to cope with the lack of those things but its not much. Cuz no one else seems to have such intentions to do great things- or at least not the same things as i do. So they either dont need to compensate for their self-hatred with dreaming about doing this stuff, or just dont care and are being numb. But i think most of them just have geniune connections, intimacy and all that stuff that is kinda like the things i decribed above. Its all the epic terms, words that we use- like ""meaningful"", ""heroic"",  ""greatness"", ""joy"" and such.  
I had a false picture about what love is. I dont know what the right one would be, but i am sure i could never love anyone the right way. Anyone i thought i loved was just someone I NEEDED. A friend, parents, a relative, a girl i feel in love with and gone crazy meanwhile, anyone. It can all be explained with the Maslow pyramid of needs. I needed safety, i ""loved"" my parents. I needed intimacy, love and sex, so i ""loved"" a buncha girls. I needed a sense of community, i ""loved"" my friends. And so on. The list is endless. All of it was fucking selfish. Lets imagine another reality, when they were on the street beside me as homeless people, i wont give a single fuck about them. Maybe their looks could catch me, but thats another selfish thing. Even if i would save my friend from a burning house and sacrifice myself, that would just be an escape from my own fear of losing them.  
And altough never getting love/affaction is the main cause of all this fuckup in my head, i can blame no one for not caring about me, other than those who directly hurt or looked down on me, because my last bit of self-respect remaining screams that the same way i did not deserve love, i was not so horribile to be hated and spat in the face.

Now that all that is said, three scenarios might happen:  
1.) I kms pretty soon   
2.) I live to give life another chance, get false hope, and hit rock bottom again. Lets see how many times i can stand. But i promise you one thing, if i notice myself getting bitter and angry and actually hurting others with ill intentions originating from all my fuckups, i will end myself before causing any further harm. There is a really realistic scenario i might just lose control and be this hateful guy we all hate, but i hope i would notice that transformation in time, and take care of it in a way, either by staying alive and regaining control, or if that is not possible, taking myself out.

3.) Or i dont, and i might actually be loved and happy. 

Either way, thanks for reading this all. It would be easy to blame it all on the ignorance of others, or on that i could never say out those things to IRL friends, but the reality is- i am a fucking man, no one should babysit over me and care about my problems which might not even exist, i either deal with this stuff alone or if i cant be strong, i shoot myself. And this is not whining like the rest of this post, just objective truth. And even though i never expected anyone to solve these problems for me, i wanted to tell someone. But the aforementioned rule about being a man still applies. Like my father once said, we are no more than just animals. The big fish eats the small one. Nature might be cruel, but we gotta adapt to its cruel laws- or else, die. And hope that fairness, unconditional love, heroics,all that stuff people sing and write about  for thousands of years, exists- in something like Paradise.  I would have a lot more to say but i dont want to write a novel. Thanks for reading my useless vent once again. Dont feel sorry for me, but i would appreciate a few words.

"I say it and I mean it. ""I don't want to be alive""","To put into words how I feel is challengeling, but I know there are many others who feel this way as well. 

I feel, at times, a powerful and overwhelming sense of dread(depressive episodes lasting hours/days/weeks/months). When those periods of dread pupate and metamorphasize into periods of numbness, like I feel this moment, that is when it moves in closer. 

Longing for comfort, my mind becomes hijacked by my subconscious, who just so happens to want to end me and is actively searching for the means to do so. 

What will my family and friends think? Who will find me and how can I avoid traumatizing someone I care about? These are the questions I ask myself when moments of clarity break through the void of emptyness. 

I want it to be peaceful. I want to feel the warm embrace of the earth as this force we call life moves from my body. I don't want to suffer, but ultimately I don't care if I do. 

Why do I feel this way? After 34.69215 years of life, and several of those spent pretending to be happy, I still continue to circle back to the same conclusion, so I say it and I mean it. I. Don't. Want. To. Be. Alive.

So why then? This question is paramount to my very existence. I think I may know the answer, or answers, even though I continue to accept their existence as acceptable.

Because food comes in colourful packages pleasing to the eye with ingredients who's sole purpose is to get me addicted.

Because we have all been taught that sarcasm and insults are a suitable means of communication when attempting to bring joy to those around us. Hah, that's gay, you're gay. The mental gymnastics we do in modern social interactions is astonishing. 

Because I can't walk there, must walk here, can't cross that line, must wait behind this line, must do as the lights command, but must not do as my impulses command, can't touch that, must look this way but don't look over there, should get a good job, plan for retirement early, work as hard as I can while I can, don't forget to 

Because I was raised by a system that requires my servitude in order to prosper.       

Because we have all been told that out there for each and every one of us is a soul mate. But they lost a critical element of this phrase in translation. The correct term is ""a souls mate"", a friend to the soul. There isn't just one, there are millions of friends waiting and wishing to find our souls. If our culture were to embrace that truth, we would all see the clearer for it, and love would flow like an unstoppable torrent. 

I am still here because I choose to embody that unstoppable torrent. I love you, who ever you are, for taking the time to read this. 

I love myself, for working so hard to become a better friend, a better son, brother, and perhaps one day I will be fortunate enough to have children so that I might put the work in to become a better father since improvement is always possible. 

I choose the path of love. Not because I want to live right now, but because I want to want to live and I still believe I will some day.

Passive suicidal thoughts,"Hey hey. I thought about making a post in this sub earlier today, but let myself calm down a bit more before that. And here I am now.

Passive suicidal thoughts have been with me for some years now, but only now I've been paying attention to them, because they're getting worse, more frequent, and turning into active thoughts.

I've always had tons of problems regarding how I see the world, those around me, and myself. I'm always behind my college friends in almost everything. I've almost nothing to be proud of, and thinking about their futures and mine, comparting how we are, gets me completely nuts. I hate myself and have reasons to do that.

But it's getting worse. I constantly fail with my friends. I do the same mystakes every fucking time. I'm way too emotional and doesn't even want to change that, cause I see it as the truth. This time I've even let down my best friend, someone I've know for 7 years. I'm always failing with her, and even made her cry this time, even though she still worries about me.

I don't change. Even though I regret what I did, I've been like this for years. I'll think about changing and then make some other stupid mystake again after some time, or even the same one. Years and years and more years, it's the same thing. I never changed doesn't matter how much I suffered or hurt others.

I've failed enough, and I have no hope of actually being able to change, as I've already tried sometimes. I already hate myself, have no reason to be optimistic or proud of anything, and everyone is already ahead of me or deals with life better than me. Now I've fucked up again with my closest friends, repeating the same stupid mystakes for years, and suffering for the same reason for years as well. 

I'm thinking about isolating myself from them,  and got to the point that I had to hold my tears while at work. I've been feeling terrible for some days already, as it normally happens every week, and that worsened everything. My anxiety and anguish are so high that I'm also thinking about just killing myself.

I'm tired, I want some peace. Maybe go back in time and change everything, every decision I made that fucked my opportunities and hurt people. But those chances, the things how they once were, are never coming back, and I can't deal with that, cause they were too special and important.

Dreaming Up My Suicide Note,"I’ve been thinking about death for most of my life. I’m 33, I have both mental and physical health issues. I can’t keep friends and can’t hold a job. My kids have serious health issues and I keep putting my family into more debt by not being able to keep a job. 

I might be autistic. I have an appointment to be screened next week. 

My husband is very mean to me and we do not have much of a bond. He tells me all the time that my health issues are a burden to the family. I can’t blame him though, because he is right. 

I can’t keep friends and feel extremely lonely all the time. 

I feel like I’m watching everyone else live their lives and have relationships, get promotions, etc… 

And I’m completely useless. 

I want to die. My life has no future except for more suffering. I have made many attempts to better my life and myself, and nothing…

I am ready to die. 

I’ve already planned how- I will overdose on heroin, which I have never used. I have never used any drugs. A large enough dose of heroin or fentanyl will kill me. 

I want a good note and leave each of my kids a little box of keepsakes and memories so they know that I love them. 

Maybe I could get a life insurance policy before this happens so that they will benefit. 

I’m not sure. I need to work out the details, but I do know one thing- I am ready to die, I just need to work out the details.",bawdymovin63,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12azodv/dreaming_up_my_suicide_note/
"Wanted to talk, so here I am","Hi, I don’t use Reddit much but I really just wanted to talk. I’m a 14 year old female and I’ve been dealing with extreme suicidal thoughts and tendencies recently. My mom and I used to live in Dayton, OH. But we moved 1 year ago due to my mom and old stepdad getting a divorce. My whole family lives there and we had to leave with a week to move in with some asshole she met on tinder. My biological father had never played a fluent role in my life, he didn’t pay child support, but I still love him and would visit him every 7-8 months for 3 weeks or so. My step-mother is extremely abusive to me and her 3 other sons she’s had with my father. But, anywho, my depression began to hit after my best friend - who I was literally born in the same hospital with a month apart - committed suicide and I was the person to find him. Weeks after that is when we had moved, my (old) friends had blamed me for his death due that I had turned him down when he had asked me out. So when we had moved I had no friends. I joined mid way through 7th grade and shit just went down hill from there. I had made some friends around a month after I had joined, they all had treated me relatively well but not amazing. A boy had asked me out before summer rolled around, I have a problem with saying no to people and after what happened with my old BFF I just said yes. The relationship was very uncomfortable for me because I’m gay. But, during the summer he had asked me for nudes, before I had sent him bathing suit pictures but nothing else. I had said that I would just send them later but he kept pushing me and I couldn’t handle that and his constant mental manipulation so I cut it off. He told me he wasn’t gonna do anything and everything was fine but I still felt like he would do something so I stayed friends with him.
Recently tho his new girlfriend has been constantly texting me and telling me to kms and that he was on the edge of killing himself when I broke up with him. I broke our friendship off a while back cause I again couldn’t handle it. I was again without friends (cause he was in the friend group) and I’ve kind of kept it that way so far. My mom works a minimum wage job while her boyfriend doesn’t work at all. We can’t afford much, all the money goes towards food, which we can barley get enough to feed the three of us and our dog. With us being far away from my family I barely talk to any of them outside of my Oba, who I call every Monday night, she tells me all the news that has been going on back home. Recently my older brother and father have passed, I visited last week for spring break to see my father before they took him off life support, he suffered from stage 4 bone cancer and he was in extreme pain. My older brother died due to a stroke, they both where never around as much as I wanted them to be, but they where the two people I strived to become the most like and I miss them so god damn much. That is the main reason I have become so depressed recently, my mother as never loved me in the correct way. She thinks making me play 6 different instruments at the age of 3 will make me happy, signing me up for ice skating, pushing me to take advanced classes to skip all of high school and go straight to college. None I want to do, I understand she just wants me to be what she never was, and she wants to have the picture frame daughter who marrys a rich man and has two children. She wants me to go to medical school and become a nurse, I just want to be a aerospace engineer, go to pilote school, work for NASA and with space, and go to the moon or mars or somewhere outside of earth. 
But I have to follow her path, her life plan for me. She points out every flaw every imperfection about my body, playing, anything. I’m doing so much but I hate myself. I just wish I could die, I can’t talk to anyone about my problems. What would I do if my mom found out I was gay, that I wanted to kill myself, that I hated how I looked in every way shape and form.

just needed to say something,"hi, my name is sylvia (pseudonym) and i am 18 years old and i am suicidal. 

i’ve been feeling this way since elementary school. from childhood to young adulthood i have struggled with my mental health and depression and i am unmedicated. on top of depression in battling bpd. i am the black sheep in my family and my brother is the golden child. my mom prioritizes him so much that she doesn’t have time to listen to me be sad. everything i do is bad. nothing i do is right. i try expressing love to my family hoping they’ll finally give me the love i’m desperate for but nothing works. 

today my mom accused me of abusing my brother because he’s scared to be around me and that devastated me. i love my brother. i only resent him because of my mother.

not only is my existence worthless to my family, also to my friends. i would do anything for them. i helped them with their depression and suicidal thoughts because i understand. however they didn’t reciprocate and have abandoned me because i am an emotional burden.

i cut off my ex boyfriend recently too. he told everyone that i emotionally abused him when it was the other way around. i don’t want to go into depth on the shit show that was that relationship.

i am very alone. i have no access to resources or therapy. the suicide hotline is a fucking joke. so i’m stuck with my thoughts. i can’t stand to be here anymore. i lost everyone i cared about. i have no family. at this point i’m just waiting until i have the balls to hang myself with a belt. i just want to be better so bad because i know there’s more to life than the pain i’m experiencing but i just can’t. i’m so excited for college but i don’t know if i’ll make it to august.

of course i’ve experienced more than what i’ve mentioned… all this is recent. just more things to push me closer and closer to the edge. i hate that i feel like i have to validate the way i feel. (trauma olympics lmao)

College admissions isn’t making it easier for me to not kill myself. My will to live depends on its outcome.,"I’ve already gotten four rejections.

This next admission decision that I’m opening up is the coin flip that will determine my life, as this school is my last foundation for living.

I remember telling my friends that if I got into some other college I really liked (not the same as the one I’m talking about now), I would brag about it. But I was rejected from there and I never brought it up again.

Complete academic and occupational success is one of my last and strongest reasons to keep living. If I could not even be successful or exceptional in those areas in my desired ways, I would most likely be in a hospital or ward right now. Exceptionality, especially in academics and capabilities, is possibly the biggest reason for me to be alive.

I gave up on my dreams to be some big-name astronomer, so now I want to achieve my second-biggest career goal: Be a Senior IT Director or something like that.  I don’t know if that’s possible for me, but I think I’m good at computer science. I kind of like computer science because I don’t find it hard. But even then, this goal of being an impressive computer science director is my last reason to live. And this school I’m talking about is the last one that I would say is the perfect place to achieve this goal.

Basically, this school has my will to live in its hands.

If I am accepted into this school, I will avoid any suicide attempts in the next few years, and I’ll try to enjoy my life.

If I am not accepted, I will die in the next six years or less.

We’ll see.

I always had signs of depression since I was like 14 or 15. I didn't have any friends to go through this together too. I have/had some, but I was never a priority for any of them. 

I feel like the end is near for me. I wasted all the extra healths the life has given me and the clock is ticking for me right now. Even if I don't end it now, I probably have to end it eventually. Because I'm living like there is no tomorrow right now. I spend like there is no tomorrow, I try to destroy my relations with people like there is no tomorrow, I don't do anything to get my life together or even to get prepared for anything. I'm just sitting here counting my days. Maybe a little bit more time would make it different for me, but it just isn't there. I can't turn back time. 

My brain is torturing me everyday. I haven't been doing anything productive in months. I've been preparing for the idea of suicide everyday.  I think I came really close to it. I don't think anyone would be hurt if I die tomorrow. It would just take 1 week for them to forget what happened to me. I'm pretty sure it wouldn't change anything for my current friends. I haven't been communicating to any of my relatives for years now. It doesn't really change anything if I'm dead or not for them. The only thing left is my parents. I'm a burden to them if I can't get a reliable job anyways, which I don't have the mental strength to get. They aren't really happy with my current depressive state anyways. I'm not someone that's death would make people sad. Because I never had that energy to live already. I don't really consider what happens after me that much. I will be dead anyways, nothing matters if I'm not living. But even if I consider it, people don't lose that much with my death. I'm already living like a ghost right now.

I really thought about it a lot but I don't see how my life would get better. My last was the most promising but I failed at it too and I don't have time to go ahead for it. This post isn't really for something momentary or temporary. I thought a lot and tried a lot too.

I dont know what's wrong with me,"I have near uncontrollable urges of sexual and violent manner for no apparent reason. I don't have any desire to hurt anyone or to have them or think about them but they exist. I sometimes enter trances and dazes of short periods where I enter another's mindset and become someone else and speak words that aren't mine but I'm aware of it so it's not dissasociative identity disorder. 

My vision and headspace is in a constant state of blurriness and foginess. I don't recognise myself as a human and my face looks wrong and alien. I enter periods of catatonia. I have no control over anything i think or feel or experience. I feel people's presences when there's no one there.

Had the worst panic attack of my life today,"For the last year I've had the most stressful time of my life. My 8 year long partner who took me out of my abusive home blindsided me with a break up, and I had no choice but to return to my abusive family. She did other things (that I wont describe but really fucked me up) while I was trying to recover from the gravity of my situation.

I'm finding it impossible to recover. I don't have anyone to emotionally support me. All my friends left me or forced me to leave them because they would constantly break boundaries. Someone who used to be my best friend hurt me a lot for completely selfish reasons. My most recent best friend ghosted me for petty reasons.

I can't rely on my mother, who emotionally manipulates me every chance she gets. I can't rely on my father (Different country + in prison) or my step father who will randomly decide a random reason to hurt me. My brother is nice but has self diagnosed with every disorder under the sun (I support him but someone like that is incapable of being an emotional support)

I go to sleep and wake up every morning looking at the unfurnished basement roof I live under. I have about 4 square feet I can walk in my ""Room"". Mice live down here, crap everywhere, and I just sleep in the crap. I don't have any choice.

Im losing hope. I feel like a zombie. I can't rely on anybody.

The stress is killing me. Today I had been feeling short of breath all morning, and m body just kind of gave up, I went numb and nearly passed out. My boss drove me to the hospital. Waited 3 hours, and they told me it was a panic attack.

Ex's mother reached out to me. Essentially told me ""Try harder"". My biggest supporter.

Im trying to combat the suicidal thoughts. its getting so difficult. every time I try to make things better for myself, someone gets offended and hurts me. I don't understand.

It doesn’t help that my parents are overbearing and annoying in one way or the other.

I can't afford to live,"I currently live with 2 partners and even with 3 people we can barely afford our rent. And that's if we can all hold down jobs. I lose every job I get due to attendance, regardless of how well I do at it. My last job they wouldn't stop telling me how good at it I was and how well I was picking it up, but apparently 1 day a week is too much to miss. I understand why this would cause me to be let go, but I just wish I could find a single employer that would even try to understand my side of things. This whole world is so fucked, it's built for nothing but money, and if something causes you to not be able to make enough money you're automatically considered worthless.

I want to live, I just don't want to spend every second of my life in servitude to some corporation just so I can turn around and buy more useless shit from them. I feel like calling this ""living"" is a lie and it should just be called surviving. I can't afford the help I need for my mental health, so I'm stuck in this unbelievably sick paradox of suffering.

Im supposed to spend 50% of my waking hours (if I get 8 hours lmao like that will happen, and it's not even counting getting ready in the morning and commutes so more like 60% or more) for my *entire life* just to be afforded the privilege to continue doing so the next day? I have no time for things I want to do, I don't even have time to do the things I *need* to do, like laundry, dishes, cleaning, showering, cooking.

Most of the people even in trans and neurodivergent supports groups under a ""good looking blanket"" don't really like to help me they are just enslaved by and capable of living this unbalanced system where power is fetishized and everyone strives to conforms by normativity.

Im super ugly and i fucked up my life. Read if u Want to,"Blah blah blah never fit in blah blah blah. i Always wanted to be a musician, when i turned 14 i decided to dedicate my life to starting a band, a successful one. Im a very anti social agoraphobic introverted quiet person so i spent lots of time sleeping, playing guitar, and listening (studying) to music. 

When i turned 14 i started acknowledging that i was depressed but i never knew my whole life would derail. By the time i was 16 i was passively suicidal and by 17 i full on wanted to just die every waking moment. 

I always knew i wasnt a looker but i became really aware of it when i was 15/16 which caused me to drop out of school because i couldn't handle people looking at my face and not fitting in / having no friends. Really shitty grades too, i didn't participate at all, just drew and stared at walls all class. I could not imagine continuing high school like that, i probably wouldve killed myself anyways. 

So after dropping out with the disapproval of my parent, i transformed into a full time homebody just sleeping all day, and when i wasnt i was trying to write songs. I really wanted to get a job but i knew my fear of people and being looked at in my stupid face would render that impossible. 

So im 18 with still no job or musician friends or any talent really. My parent hates me probably, im alone, ugly, suicidal, and starting to not give a shit about music either. I cant be a musician while being this repulsive looking, nobody would like me. (hey nobody does now!)

Im out of options, end of my rope. Short end of the stick. I know how its gonna end but i like to daydream about a better outcome. But its just that, a daydream.

I think about it all the time, and i always conclude that i have to die. Hey even if turns out im not ugly (which wont happen) then that still makes me mentally ill as fuck, and delusional!

I want to be put down like an injured animal.,"I’m going to preface this with 2 things. 

1. I don’t think I’ll make another attempt hopefully but I need more than hope right now. 
2. I’ve taken measures to get myself help and know that it’s coming. (Very slowly) 

I don’t know what happened to make God hate me in particular but I have 9 mental illnesses/disorders. C-PTSD, Anxiety, Depression, the usual works. As of a couple months ago I’ve abandoned therapy, been forgetting my meds and that’s the beginning of this exact downfall.  This led to paranoid episodes in which I lashed out at my (then, now ex) boyfriend and best friend. Like rational human beings they were understandably upset with me. So that was me getting dumped romantically and platonically. Neither of which are speaking to me now. So there goes those friends. On the other hand I’ve been suicidal before, even admitted to hospital a few times. This was a year ago. I got better, I made new friends, I went to therapy, was medicated… and now we’re back here. 

With other specifics I won’t get into I’ve been reminded time and time again that all I do is lash out and hurt people. That everyone is better off without me. 

That leaves me with an affirmation of my biggest insecurities, my biggest fears, no friends, the man I loved is gone, and increasingly worse thoughts. I just need to hold out a little longer. Which means going to strangers on a subreddit. 

Oh yeah.. I’m still only in college/university",HerefortheAITAstuff,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12atwzz/i_want_to_be_put_down_like_an_injured_animal/
Holding on for 3 years already,"There are a lot of times on my life I have thought of ending my life. I am posting through an throwaway account because I don't it is relevant enough to find me anyways. 

Lately the thought of actually killing myself has been way more prominent, I know there are stuff that is my responsibility but I started to feel alone against the world when I turned 18. I entered university, I have difficulties studying because I live 1 hour and a half apart from it and it is tiring to travel everyday and not have any time to study, and then I end up having bad qualifications and feel like I am just a failure at not meeting the expectations I have of myself. And if you ask me, I can't rent any place nearer because I cannot receive any scholarships.

All of this, and the feeling of constantly failing at everything has got me suicidal as heck. Wanting to launch myself to the subway system line, or just jump from a tower.

Suicidal over my face,"Hello Reddit. I’m usually just a lurker but I’m finally making use of my account.

To get right into the complaining, I hate how I look. My face is completely covered in acne scars of every kind to the point where I look like a burn victim. I’m a female in my early 20s so obviously this affects my life every day. I don’t like how people treat me. I hate being laughed at and looked at like a monster. I can’t take any more “butterface” or “you should try skincare” or “what’s her name, the one with the fucked up face?” comments. I wear a mask everywhere I go because I’m afraid the next comment will be the last straw.

But it’s 2023 now, I can’t wear a mask forever. I had to take it off for an interview and I just know it’s the reason I didn’t get the position that I was perfectly qualified for. I’ve been trying so hard with different makeup and skincare regimens. I’ve resorted to covering my face with glue and trying to put makeup on top of it. I don’t have the money for surgery, I’m living paycheck by paycheck. I’ve tried therapy, but no amount of self-love talk will come close to fighting off the nasty comments and the way I’m treated.

The whole thing has me feeling hopeless and disgusting. I have a boyfriend, but thats only because he’s almost blind. He would leave me in a heartbeat once he saw what I really look like.

I don’t know what to do. This is supposed to be the best years of my life and the best I’ll ever look. Part of why I stopped going to school was because I couldn’t stand the way I looked next to all the normal girls. It seems so trivial but I’m crying as I type this. I don’t want to look like a monster anymore. I don’t want people saying I’m dirty and lazy and ugly. I’ve thought about shooting myself in the face so that I can’t have an open casket.

"I don't think I'm suicidal, but I involuntarily talk about suicide","Hello. Throwaway account, seeing that IRL friends follow my main account. 

I'm a 25 year old woman, and I've suffered from Depression, Anxiety, and (probably) ADHD much of my life. The ADHD part is notable, since my father is diagnosed with ADHD (or ADD, technically, but that's inattentive type now), and the therapist I was seeing stated that I very likely have it as well, which severely impacts my executive function. But I haven't been officially diagnosed.

So, all my life, I've suffered from these...episodes that I'm gonna call a Shame Storm. That is not an official name or anything, literally just something I came up with this morning trying to describe this. And I just...don't know what they are. Or, more importantly, how to try to make them stop. They're a problem, I know. And honestly, they scare me.

It goes like this. I'll think of something that I did that was weird. Or cringe. Or elicited a negative response from someone in my life (usually a figure whom I looked up towards), and I am just bombarded with incredibly intense feelings of shame and disgust. I know that a little shame here and there is a good thing for considering my actions and how they affect others, but here's the thing. These things that trigger this response? The lion's share of them are tiny. Meaningless. Some are almost 2 decades old, interactions that have basically no relevance to my life now, have no lingering relevance in any relationships, and have probably been entirely forgotten.

And the response of shame is beyond overwhelming. If I'm alone, I'll literally seize up. My walk will stagger, I'll reach for a wall or something to brace myself against, my eyes clench shut, and all I can hear in my head are awful, negative thoughts. I'll think things ranging from *I hate myself* or *everyone hates me* all the way to outright suicidal ideation. I'll say it aloud, half the time, which is frightening. I live in constant fear of one day realizing I wasn't alone in a room, and having to explain to someone that the reason I suddenly said, ""I should kill myself"" was just because I remembered the time a teacher I liked 12 years ago asked me to stop my 'outbursts' and I was feeling ashamed, and the speech was close to involuntary.

And for a good example? Typing this out, right now, when I recalled that event, I literally just did this. Just about without thinking, I shut my eyes and whispered those exact words. And then I realized my door was open, but thankfully my house is asleep. I haven't seen this teacher in 8 years. This moment has no relation to my life anymore, and likely never will.

At their worst, I'll just about subconsciously do things like bring my hand to my head, as if to emulate a gun, and think to myself ""I should just pull the trigger."" And then my head is awash with images, gushing red as I die. Those are gruesome, and I wish they didn't happen.  It persists until the episode ends, which is thankfully usually only after a few seconds. Even still, I'm frightened. I don't want to hurt myself. I swear I'm not suicidal. I have no plans to end my life. I want to keep on living. But these episodes make even good days difficult.

This happens a dozen times per day. Sometimes more. The incidents that I'm recalling are usually a decade old, although I do get bursts and pangs of guilt from social interactions I perceived as awkward, or that I feel ended with the other person thinking that I'm a freak. It's always that same thing. Overwhelming shame. I shut my eyes and all I can hear is vitriol, about how I'm an awful person, disgusting, a burden, and I should just die.",WindValleyFirst,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12ak5ay/i_dont_think_im_suicidal_but_i_involuntarily_talk/

I keep hearing guilt tripping, comparison from other families, the ""I wish you were like this and that"" from my mother. She keeps asking ""am I a bad mother?"" And yet feels no improvement at all. She keeps on complaining about how her friends were treated like a queen in their home, how their son are so loving and daring to their mothers and such.

""Good for the son in the poor family, the one who got abused or their parents only have janitor as their job, their son is a good boy""

 But you try your best, keep upbeat, get sober, figure yourself by a fucking lot(last month I figured that i'm asexual, have aphantasia and DD (depersonalization/derealization) which are all linked and explain a lot)

You do your best to be optimistic, help, support and care about your friends despite being in terrible shape. Which you explain to them.
But when you are unable to do the things both of you like, or even what you personally like. It's scary how fast you get lonely/forgotten/left aside. My 20~ close friend circle went down to 1/2.
The last fun thing when a friend you do your best to pull out of another covert narcissist he is in love with, patiently and carefully explaining his feelings are valud and that he shouldn't be treated like he is for him to tell you to fuck off because I can't understand his feelings (when I was in the exact same spot only 1 or 2 years ago), and I make him feel shitty( effing narcissists good at deflecting).

I don’t know what to do,"Sorry if this is clumsy or incoherent rambling but I’m just typing what I feel as it comes to mind.

I just feel like I have nothing to look forward to in life, nothing seems to go well and all nice things seem to drift away. I can’t seem to form good relationships, I feel like an underachiever at work and in most aspects of my life, and can seem to stick to any hobbies.

I was always quite bright as a child, but as I grew up I started to struggle academically and could never get myself to study. I feel like I will never succeed in any field and be able to live the comfortable life which we all envision as children.

I’m struggling at the moment, at work I am stuck with my thoughts and it hurts, I’ve had to take 5 minute breaks to lock myself in a room and cry because I can’t stop thinking about everything. I’ve had to take a couple of days off in the last week because I can’t face my own thoughts. 

I’m smoking more than I ever have, I don’t even know how many cigarettes I get through in a day but I don’t bother counting any more.

Even when I’m not at work everyday things seem so hard, I just want to sleep but I can’t. I usually sleep like a log, but this last week I have woken up every night. I’m not exactly thin, and usually have a good appetite, but recently I have maybe eaten one meal a day, and that hasn’t been enjoyable. I’ve been feeling sick as well, which I guess is my anxiety, but it got to the point the other day where I was dry heaving into a bucket. I couldn’t throw anything up cos I hadn’t eaten in about 36h.

I haven’t been finding enjoyment in video games or YouTube, Netflix etc., when a video is playing it’s just in the background to keep my thoughts at bay.

This isn’t the first time I’ve felt like this, I have struggled with my mental health for the last 6 or 7 years. I’m scared that the happy times are just flukes, and that when I am happy I am just blind to all that is bad in my life.

I want to be happy but I feel so fragile.

I wouldn’t do anything as I couldn’t do that to my family who I love, but I just feel so hopeless. I’ve been looking at therapy but I don’t see what they could say to help. I’m also considering getting tested for ADHD, which I strongly suspect I have. Maybe if I am right, and I could be treated, that would help somewhat, but who knows",Loubo17,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12aw67y/i_dont_know_what_to_do/
I feel alone,I have no friends as I barely leave the house my mum and sister are the only people in my life I only see my dad twice a week. My mum and sister don’t love me they say they do but I know they would be much better off if I wasn’t here they only care about my problems as long as it’s not an inconvenience to them. They always complain that I don’t talk to them about my problems but whenever I try they just tell me to get over it or that people have it worse than I do I feel so isolated from the world I’m too scared to kill myself but it seems like the best option I’ve started biting myself cause I’m too scared to use a knife the pain makes the sick feeling in my stomach a little bit better for a few minutes but I know the only permanent solution is suicide. My dad doesn’t even listen to me he’s denied that I have adhd even though I’ve been diagnosed and it’s obvious that I have it and whenever I talk to him about my problems with my mum and sister he just laughs and changes the subject no one cares about me.

Getting Worried,"Its been over a year since I tried to kill myself (woohh go me! glad it didnt work cause there are some things that would have really sucked to miss out on /gen) but Im starting to get the feeling again and I dont really know what to do. Life is just too much for me right now and I dont really know what to do.

I make quite a few suicide jokes, cause it elevates stuff a bit, and it means I can be honest with how Im feeling without people getting too worried. Im gonna be getting drunk with some friends soon and I just really want to get drunk to ease things a little.

A girl Ive had a crush on for quite some time has just started dating another good friend of mine. Im of course really happy for them (and I will be taking the piss out of them as every good friend would &lt;3) but its just really making me reevaluate my life. I dont know if still I have a crush on her, I never stopped but the feelings just kinda lessened over time. I never asked her out cause she has her own shit going on, and so do (as shown by me being here) and I didnt want to complicate her life, so Im feeling a bit regretful. Its also making me think about last time I tried to kms as the week I was off school afterwards she started dating someone else. I am really happy for my friends, but it is making me feel pretty unlovable lmao.

I am 17, but Im seen as a little kid by many of my friends and people I know. This is due to my perceived positivity (ironic I know), my hyperactivity, which is probably undiagnosed autism, and the fact that I have a bit of a baby face. I just want people to take me seriously and for someone to like me back. I know romance isnt the end all to be all, but when most of your friends are dating people, or making out with each other (a little gross, but it shows that their wanted I guess) it kinda feels like it. I just want to feel wanted, I want to be someones favourite, or at least for someone to love me in a way they dont love anyone else.

I had a bf about a year and a half ago, but nothing really came of it and I was his rebound (even though I had had a crush on him for about 2 years before hand o\_o). He only really dated me cause he was horny, which he told me later, and for some reason that made me really self concious about how I look, which caused me to stop eating for a while. I have had a past of Bulimia starting when I was about eight and rn whenever I eat anything it makes me want to purge and that really isnt fun.

My one thing I have to live for, putting on a play, might not happen because we might not get the rights for it. I honestly dont know what will happen if that falls through, I kinda think that might be the final straw. Im just a little bit done with life.

Like I dont want to Die, I just want it to be over, I dont want to have to get up in the morning, I dont want to have to go to bed at night, I dont want to be hungry, but I dont want to eat. I dont want to do anything, but Im sick of doing nothing. I just dont want to be alive.

I am in therapy kinda, but it just makes me feel worse, I had to wait a whole year for it and I guess Id set most of my hope on it, but now its happening and its shit and Im dyslexic which causes issues with me processing words and Im also probably autistic and the lady Im seeing is from another country so we dont really understand each other as her accent is difficult for me, and I say things in non standard ways (which is hard enough for my friends who've known me for years) let alone someone who doenst know me at all and whos first language isnt english.

Im just a bit sick of it all. I just want to rest.

Realistically all thats going to come from this, is that Im going to have a bit of a breakdown, try and reinvent myself and yeah

I think of happiness as fleeting and pain is forever.,"I think of suicide as my freedom from this chain called world. Not any one of us wanted to be alive, we were forced in this world without a choice. No consent form, no terms and conditions, just boom and here we are.

Suicidal thoughts is my coping mechanism or my option A when I feel troubled. Recently, I almost failed my major subject and I tried to think positive, to do better next time, and acknowledge that I didn't do my best. But no, I look up and my ready-made ""noose"" is waving at me. 

Even without triggers, I just think of leaving this world. Whenever there is a chance that I'm home alone I think of it as an opportunity for me to do it. 

Everyday I wake up and hope that maybe I'll run into an accident and die, when I commute back home I hoped that maybe I'll get run by a big truck to the point that I'm not afraid of crossing the roads and would cross the road even when a car is coming. 

I think of death everyday. Everytime I am asked for a memory when I am happy, I can't answer, because I never rememebered myself to ever be genuinely happy. 

I'm tired. Tired of having to face the world again and again. Of telling myself to be better again and again. To think that maybe just maybe I would be okay today.

best friend walked in on me about to attempt,"im 23. earlier today my best friend of , who i live with, walked in on me about to attempt. i was on my bed, covered in blood from cutting myself and had 3 bottles of pills laid out next to me after looking up the lethal dosage, ready to make everything stop. bf called concerned by how i was talking, i was sobbing on the phone just saying “i can’t anymore, i cant” and my phone died. my boyfriend had messaged my best friend and told her to go in my room immediately, and she came in and took everything away, called my mom and her dad asking what she should do. my boyfriend showed up at our apartment 30 minutes later. they all were trying to get me to go to the ward but i begged and told them i wouldn’t go again. as soon as my boyfriend showed up and calmed me down, my best friend went across the street to stay at a hotel for the night. i feel like a fucking asshole for subjecting people to this and i already didn’t know how to live with myself now i definitely dont. i feel so fucking horrible for scaring her like that. the fact that she had to leave the house and stay across the street. i feel like an idiot for trying anything, but i just needed so bad for everything to stop. i had been planning for a few weeks. everything came to a head. 

all i fucking do is work. i work 40-50 hour weeks and do art commissions when i get home. i don’t have friends or go out. my own sister hasn’t talked to me since november, even though she knew about my recent emergency surgery and my near-attempt. i’m an artist / musician and have been so depressed hardly anything comes out of me these days, and when it does, it’s shit. my mind feels empty or overloaded, no in between. the depression is so fucking bad my hands and chest physically hurt. the social and general anxiety are crippling. i’ve been living with a recurring eating disorder since i was 12 that’s recently come back up. i hate myself so, so much. my appearance, my empty mind, my negative outlook, my work, everything. i’m constantly overwhelmed- and i can’t drink because i’m afraid of calories, i can’t smoke weed because it makes me panic, im scared of prescription meds making me gain weight, i don’t have access to other drugs, i get no relief. i just want to sleep forever. i want to throw in the towel and just disappear. and now i feel fucking selfish for hurting the very few people i have close to me the way i did. all i can do is vividly imagine my own death, i replay it in my head over and over. god i wish i could just do it with nobody getting hurt. i don’t deserve the people close to me and their patience. i don’t deserve anything i shouldn’t be here i should have just done it a long time ago. i don’t know how the fuck i’m gonna go to work tomorrow and keep pretending like nothing happened.",bignosefangface,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12ac82z/best_friend_walked_in_on_me_about_to_attempt/

Thinking about ending it,"
I have ADHD (and possibly BPD but undiagnosed so who knows) and the mood swings and inability to get shit done is slowly killing me. I don't even want to live anymore if I have to carry on with this burden. Everything is a pain to do. I called several psycotherapeuts over the past few weeks to get an appointment to get the medical treatment that I need and not one called me back, so I guess I don't even deserve help. 

I go on incredibly violent rants against my boyfriend and now we're in a break and im pretty sure he's gonna break up with me by the end of it since being with me is impossible. I feel like im just a child disguised as an adult. I can't even get my work done properly and I don't understand why I haven't been fired yet. 

Usually I just have passive suicidal ideation, and haven't felt suicidal since my late teens (did 2 suicide attempts when I was 18 and 21), but it's been a few weeks since I've been planning how I'll take my life away. I'm going slow because dying is scary and I don't want to fail and end up in the ER and having to live the rest of my miserable life severely handicapped (I know 2 persons who did that and its the worst). I have been planning and will probably make an attempt to end my life over the next weekend. 

I don't know why I'm writting this instead of doing it now. My roommate is leaving by the end of this week and I'll be alone in the flat for a few weeks, which should be enough time to be actually gone before I'm found. So I guess I have a little less than a week left. Im planning to see all my friends this week, make sure to hug them and then life will be gone.

It was always going to come to this.,"

I’ve wanted to kill myself since I was 10. My mental illness started early, exacerbated by abuse and a long line of untreated mental issues in my family. 

I’ve had a number of doctors try to figure out what’s going on but it usually stems to CPTSD, bipolar, depression, anxiety, idk I gave up on keep track of it all honestly. 

I have Crohn’s disease and it makes eating a chore.

Between my physical health and mental health, I am clinically disabled. I cannot hold a stable job, I cannot live off of benefits and if I even applied for them I couldn’t GET A job then. 

My family is sick of my shit. I mooch off the ones I love because of my issues holding a job. Anytime I get an amazing opportunity I ruin it with my issues and sabotage any chance of me getting out of this. 

I don’t see any other path for me. I never have. I dunno how I made it to my age. It was my birthday yesterday and I spent most of it just crying because this is where I am now at 29????? 

I’m useless. I will ALWAYS be a burden on my family. On my friends that have somehow stuck around despite me being such a shitty person. 

My mother was right. 

I just don’t want to feel like this anymore. My meds don’t work. 

I have my entire plan ready to go, I just need to leave behind an apology for my loved ones. And find a place for my cat. I love her and I want her to live a long, beautiful life because she’s my baby and I love her more than anything. 

I’m packing tonight, putting all of my things in boxes and cleaning so it will be as painless as possible for my family to deal with my stuff. I dunno what I want done with my corpse, I’m an atheist and tbh it doesn’t really bother me what happens to it.

I'll die on April 9th,"I have no money. I have no friends. I have no family. I have no hope, no strength, no motivation.

I was born on April 9th and I always wanted to die on the same day. 
This year I will make it happen.
There is a high viaduct nearby. Once I went there again. I approached the edge and my feet started tingling. I thought, ""I think that's what's happening."" I was scared that day and couldn't do it, but I'm not scared anymore. 
I took medicine, but after a few hours I just threw up. I tried rat poison. It tasted awful. So I put it between pieces of bread and swallowed it. I didn't understand how it happened but nothing happened.
This time I will not take any chances.
In life, bad luck has never left me. 
The more I wanted to do things, the more they didn't happen.
I didn't want a house, a car, luxuries in this life. I just wanted to be angry with myself.
At the end of the day all I have is rent to pay, bills to pay and a loan to the bank. 
These are the only things I will leave behind in life. That's why this time I know I can do it because if I can't I can't pay any of this.
I don't enjoy life. Every night when I go to bed I hope I don't wake up in the morning and when I wake up I don't want to get out of bed.
This is the first time I'm sharing this, just because I want to.
You want to do a lot of things in your last week of life, right? I don't even want to leave the house.
If I die, all my debts will be gone. I'll finally be able to enjoy the darkness in peace and quiet.",NK1864,13,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12a0yda/ill_die_on_april_9th/
"My friend is acting very weird and I don’t know what to do, please help","Me and my friends have a mutual friend whom we haven’t really talked to since high school but now we’ve noticed that she’s very active on instagram.

Our friend X reached out to me saying that she thought “ I was a great friend” and nothing more, I got worried and texted her twice and eventually called her when she didn’t answer. She ignored my calls and answered my questions saying that she was “good, or at least okay”. We’re all still studying but graduating soon so she then asked me if I wanted to go on her friends graduation party (you have to invite other people that can pay entry so that you don’t have to pay the whole sum yourself), I’m not a party person and busy so I kindly declined since she needed the answer immediately and wished her good luck in finding someone else and for her to have a good time.

Two days later (today) she posted a couple of stories on instagram, some were quoting songs but one stood out saying “Bullying can be avoided”, this is also when we noticed that her Snapchat icon has been changed to an angel instead of her usual self. 

Her instagram bio is also very concerning, “self torture, uncontrollable laughter, not selfish”

Someone please shoot me dead,"It's my first time posting here on reddit and I'm not really good at explaining stuff, I just need to let out my emotions so i resort to posting my shits here lol

I've been struggling with depression and anxiety ever since I was in 5th grade. I would constantly feel alone, miserable, and rejected by everyone. I just don't feel like I fit in every circle I'm in. You know when you're part of the group, but you're just like a filler, like when you're gone, the group won't fell apart, when you're gone, they won't feel your absence. That's me in every circle of friend I got into. I also got bullied because of my weight and appearance when I was in highschool. Because of that I isolated myself and literally did not make friends and socialize anymore until now, I'm in college btw. I literally just go out when I need to go to school and open my mouth when I need to eat. It sucks. I felt so miserable. I tried telling my mom about my deteriorating mental health but she just told me to stop my little drama lol. I felt so alone.

This 2019 when the pandemic came, my life literally freefall. My dad who was working abroad got sick and almost died and all of our money went to his hospital bills. My mom got depressed and didn't know where else to get money so I apply and work for two part time jobs at the same time while studying but its not enough unfortunately. I would literally see my mom cry every night it fucking sucks. Last year, my dad harassed me. He showed me his d*** and told me to fap it. I told my mom about it and cried in front of her, but she let it slide because my dad said sorry lol. I also got harassed by my professor in college. They are so fucking disgusting. I don't know if I'm exaggerating but it was too much for me. My life is literally so hopeless and miserable. I'm so tired and broken and I don't even have someone to tell all this stuffs to. I tried killing myself with a fucking blade but I just can't cut it deep enough because before I could even do that I would think about how my mom would feel if I died.

I couldn't hold on to something nor distract myself from it. They always linger and i can't rest. I think about kms so much at this point I'll take a slow and painful death. I'm no human anymore i can't feel anything other than nothingness and emptiness inside. I punched myself in the stomach, hit my head, broke the mirror in my bathroom because i can't even look at myself. And my parents they threw everything that I've been keeping. My alcohol, knives, my pack of cigarettes and my money. Even my ropes. It will never get better soon, so i might as well die because my existence alone is pathetic. People at my age, they have fun do stuff like normal people and i can't even stand a single day without even cutting myself or drink consistently. And even now I'm here being a pathetic, teenager who can't do shit. Even if i waited to buy a gun they wouldn't even let me. They won't take another chance and i won't have my chance to finally die. No matter how much running, no matter how many tries after tries, it would always end up like this. I will attempt, i fail like the fucking useless and incapable person i am and on and on. My body is pieces with stiches all over, my legs are dying, and overall my life is over. It was always over but i was too pathetic and meaningless to put up a proper attempt. Or forget about the voices in my head telling me to kms over and over and over nor my ability to not strangle myself. no friends or anything since really even if i wanted friends or something else i would end up with a bunch of liars or people who just don't want to me and just tolerate for their sake.

I end up resenting them and myself and just feeling like its impossible to experience intimacy and this is all a waste of time and subsequently fantasise about strangling myself or slitting my wrists to at least get people to notice how much pain I'm in, but I don't want to be someone to tries to kill themselves for attention, I'm just a massive hypocrite and a loser and a burden and nobody except my parents would care for longer than a month if I disappeared.

No way out,"(Some sexual content) 
Hello 
I hate everything about myself. I’m ugly, short, skinny, stupid, and I have a small penis. I have problems from my childhood: I cannot express my emotions well, I have irrational fears, and anxiety problems. My dad wasn’t present, my brother is mentally challenged, and my mother used to scream curse words at me, saying she was going to cut her head off. But, the worst part for me is that I have a cuckold fetish. Anything I do, I can’t fucking escape. I wanted to become a physicist; I studied for hours when I was younger, but my mother killed my enjoyment. I wanted to be good at video games, but I learned that I have tremors in my wrist and arm. In these past few years, I wanted to try to improve myself. I started working out consistently, I tried learning how to talk to people, and made online friends. I tried to stop watching porn. But as with anything, I’m just given another reason to fucking quit, because I learned about my disgusting fetish. I don’t really see a way out. How am I supposed to have fun when I can’t escape my anxiety, my fear, my lust? Every single day, I am reminded of why I want to kill myself. It’s not just the insults towards ugly, or short, or stupid people, but the fact that I wake up, I talk to my friends, and think of something absolutely gut-wrenching about them, related to my fetish. I just want to be a normal person. To be good at fucking video games. To talk with a friend without thinking of something fucking disgusting. But I can’t.

It’s been over a year and I’m still mad at myself that I failed :(,"March 19th 2022, I attempted to off myself yet again and this time it was really bad. It’s been over a year now and I’ve had one of the best years of my life but I’m still mad that I failed. I’m mad that I called for “help” too early. My plan was to call an ambulance when I was too far gone so that way no one would find my body in the park. However, paramedics saved me and I’m not thankful for it. Maybe I should be but I’m not. No one understands how I truly feel about life. I feel that life on earth is meaningless. I hate what society is and what life is. I honestly believe I was not meant for life. Everyday I think about that day in the park and get upset that I didn’t do it right and that was really one of my last chances. Now I’m scared to try it again because of the chance I might fail. I know if I do try again, I’m not calling anyone or telling anyone. I’m going to disappear and do it somewhere else. I can’t fail again. I just wish I could get it doctors assisted. I live with chronic mental illnesses that has led to chronic physical pain as well. It is what I honestly want even when I’m not depressed. Even on the good days, I don’t want to be alive. I had the best year of my life. After my attempt I met my now fiancé. I have done a lot of what I wanted in the last year like tattoos, my dream kittens. Yet I still don’t want to be alive. I feel society is bullshit. What life has turned into is completely meaningless and honestly people always tell me to go out and do more things to have fun but here’s the problem, people. People ruin everything. They get in your way. They yell and they do stupid shit. Life just isn’t what it probably was decades ago. The world has become overpopulated, the government is shit. I’m so tired of people telling me to look at the bright side of things because there really isn’t besides my fiancé and cats. They are the only reason I’m still here at this point.

My family keeps seeing me pedophile cousin despite him abusing me. But what about me? Do they not realize how much they seeing him destroys me? My aunt lives in my basement because she's a drug addict and can't hold down a job. But what about me? She brought the man who abused me when I was 4 into my life. He destroyed my life and everytime I see her, all I see is him. She is also the mother of my cousin who abused me and tried to convince me it was a hallucination. (I'm bipolar and deal used to hallucinate a lot). Why can't they just let me go. Why can't they see that I would be so much happier if I were dead. If they really loved me, they would accept it. But they don't. They don't care. And I can't kill myself because they need me. I hate my life. I'm miserable and all I want is to die. I just tell myself that it will be soon. It will happen. I won't have to be alive for much longer. I have a rope in my closet, a blade in a box on my desk. I have options, I have methods. I just have to wait a little longer. I can't stay strong for much longer and I don't think I should have to. Maybe taking my life is selfish. But how is it less selfish for them to make me live even though I'm miserable?

This coming may will be 10 years since then, and I know I probably should’ve learned to accept it by now, but I haven’t felt like I’ve truly had time to process anything, since my life has been constantly changing since. My mom has remarried twice in the past 10 years, and I even felt like I had an actual father/son bond with my second stepdad, but about 4 and a half years ago, he had an accident that left him in a vegetative state. I was expected to just move one because he wasn’t related to me, but the truth is I felt like he cared about me more than my mom, and everything else in my life has gotten harder since his accident. My moms had several boyfriends since then that I have t gotten along with, one of them even sexually assaulted me, so now I don’t even feel safe at home. I’ve lost almost all of my friends because I’ve been more withdrawn, and I have a hard time making new friends because I have autism.

These constant extentions of the martial low drive me insane.

I’m so tired.,"First I would like to say that I’m 16. And all I ever hear is “enjoy it while it lasts” and it terrifies me. Enjoy what? Thousands of assignments each term. Hundreds of social events that if I don’t go to deem me undesirable and messed up. Millions of opinions everywhere I look telling me what I need to look like, talk like, act like and who I am supposed to be. I may be young but I am far from stupid. I can see everywhere I turn that everyone is in pain. Everyone puts on a mask to hide who they really are. I can tell though, I can see that even the people telling me to hold on to hope have once lost every will and lifeline as well. It doesn’t get better, it just gets different. Different pain, different anxieties, different loss, different hollow shells of the person you once were. 

I honestly don’t understand why everyday I wake up, get out of bed, put on a smile, and try so hard for people who haven’t even noticed I’m struggling. Everyone. Always. Says. It. Gets. Better. Well when the heck does it? I’m so tired of waiting forever for it to get better. Cause it never does, therapy doesn’t work, medication doesn’t work, talking to people only leads to more pain. Every day is the same, and god I just want it all to stop. I always see people saying “imagine how sad your family would be” well they don’t have to wake up and look at this stupid body every single morning. They don’t have to fight every single night just to make it out alive. I’m just so tired, I don’t know how I’m supposed to keep going every day knowing that it never gets better and it never changes.

After she hung up I just sobbed and sobbed until my other friend called me terrified and mess worried that L would kill herself. So now here I am flying down the road rushing to her house my entire body shaking. I calmed her down and my friend got L to call her mom. Don’t get me wrong I’d still drive a hundred miles to same someones life. And I would die for this girl in a heartbeat.

Rambling (pt 2),"

I’m trying to analyze what makes me the most hesitant about suicide. I’ve already attempted multiple times before. I’m paying for the damage I’ve done to my body. Living with chronic pain and health issues isn’t fun. But even after all of that, I never felt any less suicidal. I only ever felt regret about the fact that I failed. 

Now I mostly think about what happens after. I just want my consciousness to end. I don’t want to be sentient in this body. I want to disappear from this world. It’s weirdly thrilling to think about. It’s like being sent in to scope out the scene of an uncharted world, except you never come back to report on it. 

I also think about the way that atoms are never destroyed. Traces of your life never completely vanish, no matter how much you wish it would all fade into oblivion. 

I’m tired of feeling sorry for myself. I want to go through with it. I want to leave this world behind. I want my consciousness to fade into nothingness. It’s ok if nothing comes after death. I’m sure that nothingness is a lot more peaceful than the miserable life I’ve lived.",escapescene,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12acseo/rambling_pt_2/
I tried to end it two weeks ago,"As the title goes, i tried to end my life two weeks ago. Only two of my friends know this and i only told them yesterday about it. Right now, I should do my work but i dont have it in me to try anymore and I honestly just want to give up on everything.

Only few people know I'm suicidal. Some may have their suspicions or are aware of it, but none of them know how bad of a case it is or how close I am to really just doing it. I really hate it when people know how suicidal i am.

Despite wanting to die myself, whenever someone else says that or even implies anything related to ending themselves, i scold them for even joking about it and tell them how precious they are and how much i love them so dearly. I don't let them get away with anything related to self harm, self hatred, suicidal jokes, etc basically. So, I don't allow myself to even show any implications that i have depression to any of them.

Around me, i have many people who are less fortunate than I am. Short to say, I'm privileged. I come from a quite wealthy but loving family, i have never had to worry about money or food, and if i ask for something chances are i'll get it. I travel often and go on trips with my family overseas almost every year. I have a boyfriend who cares a lot for my wellbeing and comfort,  and sincere friends who have done and willing to go through lengths for me. I get to do exciting cool things like skydiving fully funded and allowed by my parents.

But despite all that. I can't bring myself to be happy. I get excited, i am a cheerful person on default, and i am very sociable, but. No matter what i do, nothing makes me happy. Even the things that used to make me feel joy now just feel. Like nothing. I went to therapy before and even that didnt help because while i was sincere in talking to my therapist about trying the things she suggested, i was positive about things to the point that she didn't feel that i needed therapy all that much, but i was still miserable somehow inside. I never lied to my therapist, but my two sides co exist so well that even my therapist couldn't see it through. 

My friend told me that I have been clinically depressed for many many years and he suggested me to take a gap year because ive been running non stop marathons to get to where i am right now. But i cant afford any kind of rest. My dad is sick. My uni has a graduation deadline. But im still failing through it all and as wealthy as i am, uni is extremely expensive and my dad is literally on chemo.

 I just want to rest and give up. Ive been doing so well for such a long time pretending to be okay and i would say that i was a charitable person who did enough things already for others. Wouldnt it be okay for me to just. Rest now?

I say all that but I'm trying to keep strong atleast, because my dad is sick and going through treatments so if i try anything now it might hinder his recovery. 

But i really really just want to give up.

I don't know if i'll even manage to live through till the next semester.",Reverie_Bleu,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12acs4n/i_tried_to_end_it_two_weeks_ago/
Am I just..,"A burden?
Unwanted?
Embarrassment?
Something they just wanted to fuck up, gaslight, and screw over a thousand times?

Am I something's they take pleasure out of my mentality and physical abominations? 
Why did god bring me here? If I'm just a mistake? I only stayed alive for my mother, why didn't I do it 8yrs ago? 

Why should I even exist? If I'm just ignored and used as someone's toy they break and out back together

Yeah, I'm blessed with shelter and food. But am I really blessed with a family that hurts me? That never listens and whisper at night all the things they never say around me? Bad things.  

I was born as a punishment for my parents actions. I'm an unwanted burden. If I didn't exist. They'd be happier, maybe mom wouldn't have died, my dad would be rich and free, and everyone else wouldn't have to hate me so.


I'm scared to be in a relationship because I'm scared I'm going to be a screw up, that my partner would run off with someone else because I'm not good enough for them


I fear having children because I might fuck up and they hate me And that I might end up  alone.

Getting things off my chest during my final days,"I understand that the world will not change for me. I understand that life isn’t fair. I understand that nobody chooses to be born.

I’m just so unhappy in this life. I’m just incompatible with the way this world operates. I can’t suck it up and make the most of it, no matter how hard I try. The fact that I’m conscious and alive makes me miserable. 

I’ve been wanting to die since I was a child. There is probably a genetic aspect to my sadness, because mental health issues run on both sides of my family. But the physical, mental, and sexual abuse really messed me up. Experiencing poverty, periods of homelessness, and food insecurity made life even worse. 

I know life isn’t fair, but I wish it wasn’t so cruel. I’ve attempted suicide multiple times, and I’ve done damage to my body. At one point I was forcibly hospitalized in a psych ward and that really shattered me. Having my humanity taken away from me like that was terrible. One nurse tricked me into opening up to her only to use my abuse to make fun of me and taunt me about the ways I was harmed. When she found out I was sexually abused, she started touching me inappropriately as well. Unfortunately, abuse in psych wards seems to be common.

I’m not in contact with most of my family. I only really talk to 2 of my siblings, and even then our relationship is strained. My family has expressed that my suicide would be something to celebrate. It’s pretty much exactly what I expected from them. You can’t choose your family, after all.

I don’t have any friends any more either. I’ve always struggled with maintaining friendships. I don’t expect anyone to stick around when I’m like this.


I shouldn’t take this personally. People do what is best for them. It’s human nature—they’re ensuring their own survival. I lack a sense of self preservation, which makes me a  person that others are wary of. I no longer blame my family or former friends. They have a desire to live, and I don’t. They have hope. I’m weak minded and unable to move past my trauma. I am the problem.",escapescene,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12acfpl/getting_things_off_my_chest_during_my_final_days/
"Struggling last semester of college, feeling hopeless","Hi, if you're seeing this, thank you for taking the time to hear me out. It's almost 3 AM here and I can't stop crying enough to fall asleep and wait to deal with my problems until a more reasonable hour of the day. I relapsed big time on cutting, but the urge to go deeper isn't going away. I've been suppressing my emotions the past few weeks to try and ignore how out of control my school situation has gotten, but I reached a breaking point tonight.

To make a long story short, I'm graduating in a few weeks and am getting absolutely fucked this last semester. I fought for a 3.9 GPA for three and a half years, and now I'm tanking because I decided to be a moron and finish a second minor in addition to my major and a certificate. I ended up with a tough grader for two of my minor classes, and despite getting As on all of my essays in the past, there's nothing I can do to please this guy. He's a nice person, and I admire his commitment to academia, but I am simply not strong enough for this shit anymore. I made an attempt on my life this past December, survived, kept it a secret until I thought I was getting sepsis from my injury, tried to get hospitalized for suicidality but was turned away, and am now riding out this extended depressive episode until I can afford therapy. This culminated from many years of dealing with depression, OCD, BDD, and BPD. I also have a chronic illness that literally sucks the life out of me: I just wrapped up a period that lasted 2 months (my record is 6!!!) that kicked my ass even more because of my eating disorder and left me anemic. My family has tried to get me in-patient for a long time, and I was finally ready to go, but by the time I went, a few days had passed since my suicide attempt, so they just referred me out-patient and sent me home. Within two days, I was back in my dorm to start classes after winter break.

At first, I was grateful for a second chance at life. I looked forward to finally finishing college and prioritizing my mental health once I got that hurdle out of the way. Now, I have 3 missing essays, a ton of pending projects, and nothing left to give. I work two jobs and was recently promoted to manage a research team, which I appreciate, but it has added even more stress. I'm in the middle of applying to grad schools and am dealing with ongoing family issues on top of managing this semester. All I can think about is how much I regret not succeeding in December. It was actually my second suicide attempt; the first was when I was 16, and this most recent go-around was 22. I know I'm close to getting out, but I feel so stuck, and I just can't fucking take it anymore. My GPA is going to plummet regardless, and I don't even know if I can still drop classes anymore. I don't know how I'm going to get everything done. The fucked up thing is that I could've graduated last semester, but I just had to complete this fucking minor. It was a mistake to take more classes. At this point, I don't give a fuck about history anymore. If I could, I'd drop it in a goddamn heartbeat just to get my diploma and run. I just want to get out of here, but I'm scared it's too late and that I've ruined everything by laying in bed all day trying to dredge up the energy to brush my teeth and shower. Everyone keeps telling me it only gets harder after school to try and put this into perspective, but the problem is, I know that. I'm afraid I'm not cut out for living a productive life. TBH, I don't really care about my grades anymore, it's everything else that cobmes after that makes me want to give up while I'm still so far behind. There's a lot I haven't explained that's going on outside of school, but I'm obsessing over this because it makes more sense than trying to figure out why so many of my family members are addicted to drugs or why I've basically wanted to die since I was 9.

I stopped writing because this is already too long, but, TL;DR: pretty sure I'm gonna fail my last semester of college even though I already completed my degree. Fixating on it to avoid thinking about bigger issues in my life. Considering my third attempt.",ZipperArms,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/12ace4i/struggling_last_semester_of_college_feeling/
I want to live.,"Everyday its been the same tasks; The days were passing. I'm 18 so, maybe its okay that I don't have a job right? I mean I had gotten to take classes at my local university for free. In my state its allowed for juniors and seniors to take classes at the uni if they get approved. Anyway's, It was free school at an early age. Something nice and cool to kind of boost about but deep down, I really didn't care. I don't know why at that moment I realized that. I don't know what I'm doing with my life, I've felt so lost and disconnected with reality that I made my own kind of world where nothing mattered because it would end if I wanted to. I mean so be it. I would just accept it and just waste my time. The classes I was doing was hard enough and good enough, right? But I felt lost It didn't matter if it was enough because I felt like shit. I don't talk with my family. I Don't do anything at all. I'm overweight. I'm lazy. I'm a annoyance to everyone around me, I don't feel like I fit in. So I drowned it with games evetime something bad would happen in my life. Probably since I was in the 4th grade. Any problem would be solved because it would just go away with games. I don't blame the games for my problems or something like that. Its just the way I would stop focusing on the problems. Over a year passes and im still living this sad life, of just playing games to ignore my overweight self, my bad posture, getting a job, learning to drive, to live. I was just living this cycle of just endless insanity. I made an attempt. My ""loved ones"" found out quickly. I say ""loved ones"" because I didn't feel loved, I felt like a problem. It was me. Nothing happened after that, I said I was okay and fine and everything was okay and and, it was over. They stopped caring again. I mean I told them it was okay. But I just felt embarrassed to ask for help. Now its past, two years I'm 18 now. Its the same. I should just end it its the same problem but it only seems worse now. I feel worse then ever now. I want to do it. I want to do it so badly. But I don't have the courage to do it. I'm lost now writing this at at 5am. going to wake up at 12pm when its far too late. I want to make my best version of myself but I don't know if its even worth it. Because what's the point of living. It will all just end either way right so who cares man. I just want to be happy but fuck that's too hard right. I'm just so lost. I want to do it but I want to live. I'm saying goodbye to the old Francis. And hopefully I want to live.

What do I do with my intrusive thoughts?,"I was diagnosed with suicidal ideations. Which is a problem that I'm dealing with but right now I'm also dealing with very bad intrusive thoughts... I wont go in full detail as to what they are cause they aren't appropriate to share on this platform. It's like I'm hearing voices and it wont stop.

I've been listening Green noise and white noise stuff to help hearing something constant, and it seems to help a little, but I'm at my wits end. I just got out of the psych ward. I don't want to go back. And though I do think about death, I don't actually have a plan or anything. I'm not against death either, and I want to believe there is possibly a better outcome. Though, I don't think it's possible.

What should I do?? I asked my therapist about one of the things I am also struggling and she was telling me the new me is better and the old me was wrong, even though this new me is pathetic and fake. I'm a sadist and I hide it cause I was constantly told I was a bad person for it, so I pretended to be this moral based girl with stupid values that are just stupid. Everything is stupid. And ever since I confided in my therapist the intrusive thoughts are getting worse. Most of the thoughts aren't so harmful exactly, but can be considered highly immoral and the others are just down right dangerous. Don't get me wrong I enjoy the thrill of danger, but I'm not stupid. Which is why I have been able to suppress most of the intrusive thoughts, but its getting harder everyday when It's all I think about.

"Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis","Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",circinia,80,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/11vys6c/regular_checkin_post_with_information_about_our/
"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",SQLwitch,178,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/
I’m committing suicide,"I (25M) graduated college with a biochemistry degree last year. I have been studying for the medical school entrance exam for the past three years on and off but couldn’t retain any information I studied due to high anxiety and burnout. It’s been nearly a year since I graduated and I was pursuing a research position afterwards. I got a decent MCAT score now, so I can apply to medical school. However, this coming year, I don’t have any jobs lined up, I don’t have job offers and nor do I think I’ll get any. I’m all alone here in the U.S. so not having family support me financially is taking a toll on me. I am living off of savings after quitting a job that was making me severely depressed. My money will run out soon and I’ll basically be homeless. The idea of graduating with great distinction but then getting a job at a fast food restaurant is taking a toll on me, and I for some reason can’t get this idea out of my mind. I am by no means someone who values status, so I don’t know why I am so afraid of getting a job at Burger King or something is that big of a deal. I want to save money for my medical school applications, but what if I don’t get in due to my below average MCAT score? I am severely depressed. Everyday I study with my best friend for a few hours but I feel very unproductive. I have absolutely no direction with my life. Especially living in California is eating up all of my savings and I am extremely nervous. I don’t even have a car to be living in my own car or make money by doing Uber. I am currently contemplating suicide as I have no other options it seems. A research program I applied for all of a sudden said they’ll have to conduct three interviews with me. I’ve done interview with two people, but I don’t think I did well because I was so nervous I didn’t even prepare. I only have one interview left for next week and I can’t get myself to stop thinking about it. I have been through a lot over the years, tried committing suicide multiple times, have become homeless and I am now just giving up. Life’s knocking me down left and right and I can’t take it anymore. I have no one who will be by my side except from my savings that’s running out. I’m scared of the physical pain for 4 minutes if I hand myself, but I really want to kill myself. I’m done with life.",phymathnerd,21,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12day83/im_committing_suicide/

I'm not well equipped to live.,"Hello guys. I constantly get depressed when I'm hit with the reality that the genetic lottery is not favorable to me. I'm a 21M with no talent, zero defined skills, an average IQ, and the cognitive incapacity to quickly learn life skills. Economy is strictly harsh in my country and those who are able to live comfortably often tend to demonstrate a commendable level of cognitive capacity by learning important life skills to live. 

Unfortunately for me, I'm not well equipped to reliably adjust to this reality. I don't exactly know what work will befit my personality as I'm extremely introverted with signs of ADHD. Whenever i think of this condition, I immediately get depressed because adulthood is harshly competitive and survival is essentially premised on a high cognitive ability, which I don't have.

i worked every single day to not be alone in my thoughts and to keep me distracted so i wouldn’t end up crying the whole day and i over exhaust myself to go home and just lay down with nothing in my mind. but i feel like that probably made me worse and into the person i am now…

not crying made me think i was getting better, but to be honest i think i have gotten worse. i researched enough and i have assumed that i have undiagnosed bpd but i don’t have the funds for a therapist or medication unfortunately. i have a diagnosed sleeping disorder and the medication is already a hefty amount to pay as well… so i really have to rely on pills for the rest of my life in order to feel hardly an inch of happiness?

I got prescribed Effexor by the psychiatrist.

But I think I will get better if I can rest.

I am not really sure if I should take Effexor atm.

I saw SNRis can increase the possibility of dementia later in life, may impair cognitive function during and after taking it, and have withdrawal symptoms.

Taking SNRIs in my case, seemed like making other sorts of problems to run away from the one I have now.

I’ve been trying my hardest.,"So I’m 31 female, I’ve been trying my hardest to make myself feel better. I’ve been booking time off of work and making plans with family and my boyfriend over the days I have off. 

I’ve been speaking a lot to my doctor also as antidepressants aren’t doing a thing no matter what dose, she ran blood tests and I’ve found out that I have vitamin deficiencies which can be the cause of my low moods and I’m now on medication for that :) so that’s good. 

I was so looking forward to my time off of work to start going out more and actually having a social life until people begin to cancel. My sister was going to go out with me today for a shopping trip and coffee so has I did her a favour yesterday by having her daughter sleep round so she could catch up on some sleep as they’ve been sick, I got myself and her daughter ready to go out and I took her back home so we could head off and she decides to tell me that her, her partner and the kids are going to do exactly what we had planned for the day and I basically didn’t get an invite so I headed back home, oh well I still have plans with my boyfriend tonight…wrong! 

He’s just called me to say he doesn’t fancy going out to the restaurant tonight as he decided to have a big lunch with his colleagues, he’s spent too much money, he’s full, tired and he won’t be back until about 6pm tonight but maybe I should take myself off to do something alone like go get my hair done and people wonder why I’m miserable!!
My partner is quick enough to suggest us both taking his son out though to the fucking park or cinema to do kid stuff! So it’s a day in for me today as it will be tomorrow also and then back to work to repeat the same miserable cycle.

"On treatment for depression for 4 months, something feels different.","[24 f] I have been on treatment for major depressive disorder for the past 4.5 months [3.5 months of Fluoxetine/prozac, then Pristiq (desvenlafaxine) 100mg and Abilify (aripiprazole) 1mg for the past month]

For the past 2 weeks, I have experienced an improvement in mood, completed a creative project I had been procrastinating on for almost 2 years, and made a ton of purchases (some necessary, few I could have gone without). I was impulsive before too but I have noticed this 'shopping addiction' to be new. I used to spend time browsing shopping websites before too, but never actually purchased anything. Also I am spending a lot of time thinking about and planning for a trip I have to take post exams, rather than studying for the exams. Also I have noticed impulsive behaviour regarding my sexual life and an increase in libido that had previously gone down to zero when I was on Prozac. Food intake has been the same as before. 

These all are pointing towards mania, but I'm in doubt because I don't have any irritability or decreased need for sleep. In fact I experience waking up a few times at night and then feeling sleepy the whole day- I would sleep if there wasn't the compulsion to study. Also I feel guilty after my impulsive decisions at times and have cancelled a number of orders after shopping.

I'm afraid I'm going into mania, or is this me recovering from 2.5 years of depression, having forgotten what normal feels like?",fumbling_porcupine,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12dhwwk/on_treatment_for_depression_for_4_months/

From where our fear comes?
Isn't it come from the fictional standards set by society?

Is there anything like imperfection?
Isn't everything there as it is, perfect, complete in its own way the 'falling leaf, the sunshine, drying mud, a rock with thousands of tears, a flower blooming and dying?

Can our mind be free from conditioning? 
If yes then how would it feel to be free?

Is life comes with a timeline? 
Or comes with an assignment to do, to be married at a certain age and have kids and so on?

Or this timeline is an'fictional' idea created by the collective mind of society? And our mind is influenced by this idea, that creates an another idea, an idea of being late, which is as untrue as all other ideas created by the mind ?

Can we see through it and come closer to the truth which makes us free from all fictional ideas?  

Truth is very simple: everything is good as it is, everything is perfect in it's own way, life never judge us 🙂

"Excessive rumination leading to exhaustion, confusion and existential dread","I can see myself getting lost in useless (mostly) irrational thoughts - like an in-built internal wall that has consequences in real life as exhaustion, confusion and existential dread. Too many thoughts to even grasp and it’s difficult recognising what feeling could be behind or from where they are (also I deal with alexithymia). I dream of having 1 thought at the time instead I get many doubts without clarity. I label them as irrational (even if I’m rigid and without much creativity in real life).

 Most doubts are without answers and are not relevant per se (not about concrete issues), just getting in the way of my everyday life. Theme are recurrent - about fear of the future and others as “if I can’t do this easy thing I will not do bigger thing” “I don’t know what I like, I fear I din’t really like anything” “I’m not interested as I used to” “I’m not sure I’m learning X, what if I was just lucky and ca’t replicate” “having to go through everyday life is a lot, the bare minimum drains me too much” “I don’t feel better after doing stuff” “lot of nonsense and I ca’t find a direction in life” and some random thoughts that I know are more kind of intrusive “if Kim not paying attention I will do an enormous mistake (I don’t know what)” and fear of getting hurt concerning heights and cars

Without realising much later, I do follow the scheme of: rabbit hole kind of excessive rumination, like I need to be certain (more certain than now), I need to figure out why or what’s behind (hours of rumination - no answers just replaying thoughts), I’m reviewing what I know and what I don’t know and the conclusion is nothing. The only anti-rumination skill I have is distraction by consuming media or massive daydreaming (not about myself, more nonsense I would say). 

This also lead to a major practical consequence - itself a rumination theme: I do feel demotivated in general seeing how little control I feel over the ability to “decide and do things”. I can’t predict if I’m going to do what’s planned or feel overwhelmed without apparent reason. I’m destroying those little changes and little goals I have, all due to lack of consistency. I’m not saying I want to reach an expected adult consistency, the problem is even at earlier stages and more profound. It’s evident to me that I don’t own the key to my own motivation and therefore I encounter big struggles in getting things done, plus rumination in the way. 

For what I see it’a not getting better with years and counseling
Good: I know myself better (2 diagnoses, ASD and alexithymia) still I feel like
1)  I lack a pice in order to “get things done” - at cold mind, I can totally see why, how or likewise reasons to do things, it makes perfect sense, but it’s nearly impossible to “do” them (and being able to replicate, I get random results) and it looks just like excuses. It’s frustrating. 

2) i have days, weeks, and months where all falls behind rumination, headspace become pure confusion.
I thinks too much and if I look at probability it’s anxiety driven. Still in my case I see more irrational than useful or factual driven. I mean in my knowledge anxiety is about future-concrete-things, not messy-uncertain-without answers thoughts. I’m bad at predicting future and I only feel anxiety at highest level, so for example, I don’t worry about my exam until the 2 weeks before, I do this excessive doubting everyday instead. Also  I’ve read something about ocd and I totally relate to the need of certainty, the obsessive research for answer and the self-doubting but my intrusive thoughts are not always at center. I may jump here, I may crash a car,I’m not a good person are intrusive thoughts, but others are self-doubting thoughts that leads to rumination - so I don’t know what’s behind. 

It’s a bit too much to handle such a messy headspace and to try to live-first-person life without much motivation - I know I’m missing something but I can’t figure out yet.",Maris_ND,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12dlxib/excessive_rumination_leading_to_exhaustion/

I feel like a robot again and it's a bad thing now.,"This is just a rant/off my chest moment. 

I've been on depression medication for over a decade. 

Life always had its ups and downs, but on the medication it was good for many years. I never really mentally revisited my past emotional state once things were looking up. I never had a huge depressive episode once my meds were stable, so it just never occurred to me to look back on it and reflect.

My life fell apart recently in the worst possible way. I'm starting over in life. Alone. After being stabbed in the back. I have no purpose or meaning anymore. Now, I'm mid-30s and never had my own apartment or lived by myself. There are so many things that terrify me and keep me awake at night. I've had panic attacks over things as basic as credit cards and retirement accounts. I'm truly pathetic. Of course no one loves me. No one ever has. I was a fool to think otherwise.

My mind just....... broke at some point? It was too much. I couldn't handle it all. I got on short-term disability for my depression thanks to my doctor, which I am so f-king grateful for I can't even express it. My doc saved some of my sanity and future livelihood with that and a Xanax prescription.

Now that reality has begun to settle around me... I'm back to feeling the way I used to feel before my medications. (Despite still taking my current medications.)

I feel empty and lost. I get out of bed cause what the f-k else am I supposed to do? I sit in my office and stare at a screen cause that's where I would normally be. I start up a video game or movie to distract myself and I forget what I just saw or what I was just doing. I rewind the video. Watch. Rewind it again cause I still didn't process it.

I make schedules and checklists and phone calls to prepare for my move 'cause that's what I should be doing, even though I don't want to, even though my mind and heart aren't in it, even though I'd rather just crawl in a hole and wait for the universe to end. 

I packed over a month in advance because... well... I'm supposed to pack. I'm moving. That's what you do when you move. You pack. I'm out of things to pack that I don't use daily. I can't move forward because of time now. I sat and waited cause that's all I can do. The sun goes up, the sun goes down, I waited.

What am I waiting for? To move. Why? 'Cause that's what I have to do now. What will I do after I move? Unpack. Then....... then what? Wait to die?

I've always had functional but severe and chronic depression. I grew up like that because NOT doing what I was expected to do was never an option thanks to my parents. I got up. I went to class. I did the homework. I got good grades. The years flew by and I don't remember the vast majority of them because I was in a depressive haze without purpose or meaning.

I was a robot.

I feel like a robot again, but now it's a lot harder because the pills gave me emotions.

This feeling is horrible now. It didn't bother me before. I wonder if I'd be better off without the medication. Would the numbness be better? Not remembering would be better. If I could blur out the last decade of my life, well... right now, I probably would.

My parents were drunks. I drink now, too. I swore I never would. I want to get drunk. I want to forget. (I don't have kids or anything, this hurts no one but me so it's fine.) I swore I'd never to drugs. Now I wonder how to get them.

I don't want to be here anymore. My life feels stuck and pointless. The walls of my cage feel smaller every day. I think I'm doing dumb and reckless shit just to get out of the house, to feel something other than pain and hopelessness, to try to find some kind of point to my life. But I don't really care anymore. Why should I?

Sure, I'll get in a car with a complete stranger I met on the internet. What does it matter if he kidnaps, rapes, or kills me? He seems nice enough, I'm sure it'll be fine. It only hurts me now, after all. Let's have a drink and some pizza, sounds like fun. 

I'm dumb. I've lost my sense of self preservation. I'm looking for a point to all the pain and suffering and betrayal and heartache and distrust and meaninglessness. I'm looking into the void and I'm shaking. I hate the medication for making me feel, I hate that it makes suicide seem like a bad idea, I hate it for making me want to chase a better feeling.

I guess the pills work but I don't like them anymore. I wonder why I still take them. Cause that's what the robot is programmed to do.",arewar,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12dbmzz/i_feel_like_a_robot_again_and_its_a_bad_thing_now/

Stuck.,"Wake up , eat junk food , day dream , go to sleep , repeat. Of course , let's not forget fapping , as depressing as it sounds that's the life I've been living in the past 3 months described in 4 simple and very comprehensible  words.

&amp;#x200B;

Believe me or not ... it was way worse than this , about 7 months ago , I was even more depressed than I am now, I was so depressed and fed up with my life to the point where (surprisingly) I took action, I started eating healthy, I started reading books and going outside more, I cut all of my degenerate friends and built a good social circle, I started taking care of myself and being more positive about me and the future. I wanted to prove my self that I'm worth more that what I think I am , I can achieve my wildest dreams ... and it worked (for a while that is) While some of the good things and habits that I've built (before the ''downfall'' started again) still remain in my life , like reading books  , having high ambitions , learning HQ skills and Finances ... I recently realised that I'm not that much different to how I was 7 months ago, I've been slowly (and more painfully) getting back to my old habits.

&amp;#x200B;

My life is an infinite loop of just sadness, I daydream (to avoid doing good habits) then I wake up to reality and realize how shit my life is and that I just avoided doing a good habit ... so guess what I do after that ? I daydream , the cycle repeats. I'm (quite literally) the pure definition of a loser , someone who lost , I'm trying but I'm just ... not enough , and that's okay, I've realised this is a toxic thought pattern and the best way to deal with it is just by being honest, not being honest just causes me more pain and suffering  ''Yes, I am a loser ,  but that can very easily change if I take acction'' what I've also realized is that I simply lack the willpower and brainpower to create long term habits, and my only hope for change is for life to give me another good ol' slap in the face to wake me up to reality , I know that's coming however I would still like that not to happen.

&amp;#x200B;

Every habit that I do during my day does nothing but make me more and more depressed, every time I day dream , I eat junk food , or I just do another dumb thing to avoid change I just remind myself how big of a ''loser'' I am and that I won't achieve shit if I don't start being productive ... even after months and months of this shit , life reminding me (by failing tests and family issues) that I should wake up I still . won't . change.",JhonSmith594,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12dlfui/stuck/

Struggling to keep going,"I (18M) started going to college a few months ago before which I had to study for an extended period of time to get into college. During those that time from 10th grade to 12th grade, I was put into a tutoring class that required me to show up at 7 and leave at 2 or 3 and then gave us enough work to ensure that we wouldn't be free until 12 at night. They gave us at least 30 practice questions for the three main subjects ( I am not disclosing this because I don't want people to know which exam I'm talking about). This was happening during covid from 2020 to 2022 during that time I was not able to understand all these hyper-complex concepts but I would still get up every day and watch and rewatch the recordings of the Zoom meetings solve sums and much more. Alas, that wasn't enough because every Sunday we had a test to check our progress I would always be below the mark. I could never quite make it to the required score. This killed me on the inside I felt incompetent because prior to this I performed quite well academically but seeing my performance made me feel as though I couldn't do any better and I was bound to fail. This ultimately led me to think that I wasn't studying hard enough so, I started waking up at 5 am and studying for 2 hours before class and studying till at least 12 am. I did this all throughout 12th grade but to no avail, because no matter how many sums I solved, no matter how many workbooks,  went through I couldn't get the required marks to get into my dream college.I was genuinely suicidal for a period of 2 months before the exam but I somehow managed to get over that. Then came the exam I had been working so hard for I gave it with no hope of even passing but I got an okay score but I couldn't make the cut. I got into another okay college that I wasn't happy with but I went anyways because another year of prep would have killed me. I was so disappointed in myself that I vowed to never get low grades again. Now we come to a few months ago when college started all I did from day 1 was study, solve questions, and focus on my academics in general. I did this by waking up at 6 am every morning for the entire sem even on Sundays. During this time I was under immense pressure I had no life outside my books and I always felt trapped but I continued and ended up getting a 9.4 GPA for the first semester. Currently, I'm in my second semester and I have tried to stop stressing over academics so much but my grades have decreased slightly and it's giving me such heart-wrenching anxiety attacks and depression that I can't function properly. I really don't want to have to study like that again giving everything else up but then if I don't then I won't be able to do well and achieve anything of significance in my life.

"Never ending bad run of luck, I am starting to think I am cursed.","It's not my first or third time battling the black dog. I recently got laid off at work, despite doing a great job and totally out of my hands. This was the final nail for me, and I am really concerned.

Recently over the last month, I have found multiple dead birds lying beside each other on my property. Some on the roof, some in the yard. No signs of shooting or harm, just fell out of the sky. Something keeps coming onto my roof and having explosive diarrhea as well, an animal. I can't even bring myself to clean up, it has been weeks.

I'm really worried something is coming for me, I have a seemingly never ending run of bad luck that doesn't let up. Every win is a veiled problem, and every problem is unending. Nobody who I speak to takes this seriously, but everybody admits I do have exceptionally bad luck.

I have a drink and drug problem but I live with a partner and she has seen what us happening and its not in my head. I can't afford the help I need and I am very concerned. Even if I have the help, it's a not a real solution.

My username is a new account, I deleted my old one. I'm pouring my darkness into generative AI images. My partner doesn't agree with me, but I feel such a growing hole inside me I have to do something.

Anyway I don't even know what I am doing here. I am proactively looking at methods of suicide but I am a coward. I don't agree its right so keep going just because people need me, but I am still scared of ending things.

I'm kinda done. I have becker's muscular dystrophy. i'm severely disabled and in a wheelchair. I'm 30 years old, and my condition is getting worse. I have no hope for romantic relationships, marriage, kids, and no longer find any meaning in my life. I used to be a rabid bernie bro, but have over Covid become completely and totally disillusioned with every single fucking religion and ideology. It's all a fucking scam. I'm always lonely most of the time and just spend my days doom scrolling after dealing with my meaningless help desk job. my mom is blaming me for messing with her ""positive vibes"" because she believes every fucking person is a toxic narcissistic vampire draining her energy as she went down the pop psychology youtube rabbit hole. She's saying maybe angry people should eliminate themselves from this planet, and then sneers and says ""I have a hard life too, and you don't see me complaining. How about I send you to a psychiatric hospital? Clearly you need help. You seem to be weak. You're a fully grown man. You figure it out. I don't care if you leave me to go to a nursing home"". My friend called me a diva too. 

No one fucking cares. I don't know how I can even kill myself with a high chance of success given that pills tend not to be as lethal. MAID in Canada (i'm in the US) sounds like a pain to arrange, nor can I get a ride. Psychiatric hospitals sound like hell, and nursing homes will deprive me of any remaining quality of life.

Now I understand why my father turned to heroin and ended up ODing on it (accidental they said, not suicide attempt) in 2008. He understood how empty life is without drugs.

I feel there's no empathy and understanding in the world. The narrative online is becoming increasingly violent and genocidal. I see through most people's surface level talk and feel i see their true dark feelings. Are we really surprised more ""incidents"" with you know what are happening more often? Everyone is isolated in their own social media bubble.

I kinda am losing hope here, and feel like I almost want to show people I'm not joking about my feelings. But, I don't have easy, effective means that will minimize the pain to actually do it.

Depression and drinking has ruined my life,"So idk what to say this is a throwaway account but depression has ruined my life. That with drinking has really made me go insane and now trying to think of fixing this is hard. I became a regular at a bar because I hated being home alone and it was easy to laugh and pretend everything was fine drinking until I was blackout drunk. Now I want to stop the drinking and drugs because it recently led me to be suicidal. But during this depression my life has completely changed. I used to be a clean freak, who had money saved in the bank, and drive. Now I my place is so filthy I hate being home and I feel bad for my dogs because I can barely function. They deserve better and a happy home. I never thought this would be me that I just look around and everything feels so so bad. I stopped paying things and used the money for cocaine and booze. I fell so behind in bills when I used to pay everything well in advance. Now I’m looking around wondering how I dig myself out of this hole when suicide seems like the easier route than facing my debt and ruined home. I literally am barely paying my mortgage and almost lost my job to this and still can’t focus at work. I just need some help or guidance from someone who has been in a similar space.

Is Depression relapse a thing?,"About 4 months ago I was diagnosed with MDD…I didn’t realize how bad things were because I hadn’t felt anything in years. Things that used to make me happy or excited felt like a chore or I would do them out of obligation to friends or family not wanting to let them down.  

My doctor put me on 20mg Viibryd. I had three good days the first week that left me so hopeful and motivated but then right back to my normal state of constant insomnia, sleeping all day, not doing housework, taking care of myself, etc. I felt like I had so much hope in this medication from those 3 good days I had but now nothing was changing? (In fear that alcohol would stand in the way of progress with this medication I had stopped drinking almost completely prior to starting it to ensure it would not interfere with my medication or my feelings/actions). 

Fast forward to the next month…I am a hurricane of uncontrollable emotions but none positive. I was angry, sad, upset, having mental breakdowns and crying multiple times a day. After I would have a meltdown or pick a fight with my husband I would immediately feel guilty and apologize. I felt like a monster. I started therapy around this time. I hated myself. 

My husband is so supportive, understanding, and patient. We share the same psychiatrist so when it was time for him to go in and renew his meds, our doctor asked him how I was doing. He told him about my episodes and how out of character all of that was for me. He told my husband that I needed to call him. But I continued taking the medication and figured if I made it to the 3 month mark (when I needed to meet with my doctor again to renew meds) and was still feeling like I was not in control of my emotions I would ask him to switch my meds. My appointment was 3 weeks after my husbands.

Within a week of my husbands appointment I had a complete 180. I didn’t want to stay in bed anymore, I didn’t have any mental breakdowns, I felt in control of myself and my emotions, I wanted to do things I hadn’t cared about in years, and I felt joy and happiness again for the first time in YEARS. It was incredible. To grasp normalcy right in front of you after not being able to imagine that for so long.

I went to my psych appointment and told my doctor of my rollercoaster of a ride and how I was doing. All was well. That was about 3 weeks ago. Now the last two weeks I see my depression signs coming back up….extreme exhaustion no matter how much or little sleep, feeling paralyzed even with amphetamine, little joy and everything feeling like a chore, not being able to complete or start tasks around the home, and not caring to take care of hygienic needs. 

Is this normal? Can I move past this? Do I need a higher dosage? I have never met anyone else on this medication and I know everyone’s depression symptoms are different but unsure of if this is normal or not? Should I be worried? I am so disappointed in myself because of how well I was doing, now I slowly see myself going back to square one.",Maximum-Painter-5953,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12dcxz7/is_depression_relapse_a_thing/

Did therapy help you? (+ my story),"Hi all,

I was diagnosed with moderate depression November 2022. My depression is very much work related, things have been bad and difficult at work for quite some time. 

I've been working in this company for about 5,5 years. I work in an office, there are 3 other people, all of them are owners (and my mum is one of them). I've been having difficulties with one of my co-workers. I can't remember how everything began, but this has been going on for about 2 years. In short, she has blamed me for all kind of random things; yelling, doing work in wrong order, selecting the work I do, throwing the office phone, pulling papers from her hand, saying that I hate her, saying parents and children shouldn't work at the same company (she said this to my mum and my mum told me. Hearing that wasn't nice).. She also seems to have a major issue with me working at the same company as my mum, she seems to think I'm just waiting for my mum to retire so that I can have her share of the company (this isn't true). Also this co-worker keeps ""spying"" on what I do, this has been going on for years. I once mentioned about this to her and she acted like she hasn't done anything, but other people at the office have noticed that she ""spies"" on what I do. For example when my mum helps me with something, this co-worker often walks past us and takes a long look about what we are doing. All of this has really taken a toll of my mental health, and I finally kind of ""collapsed"" last November. I was on sick leave for 2 weeks, and now I feel that might have been too short. Before that I frequently cried at work and sometimes at home after work. I've been crying at work after my sick leave as well, but not that often.

I know quitting and applying for another job would be a good solution and I've thought about it sometimes. But I feel like I don't know anything about my job and that nobody will hire me because I have very limited skills.

I've found a therapist, but I'm unsure about seeing her. I know it propably would be helpfull, but I don't know how seeing a therapist would help if nothing changes at work. I've told some of my work concers to my mum, and she told me not to stress and just forget everything my co-worker has blamed me for. One doctor told me I could have burn-out as well, and I feel like that is very possible.

Life Making Friends,"I'm drowning in my tears, stuck in a landslide after being dejected from reality and society. Now all I can feel is sorrow, a commitment to being validated and a concept of poorly being understand. Hyper awareness, straining back to the top, trying to earn my respect. It's a fantasy, when I try to make friends. Being left behind and excluded, used and mistreated. Not being cared for, stuck with melancholic. Nobody likes me. A simulation where nobody ever will, tis is the reality of me. I want validation, a pathway to happiness. Someone will care, but all I want is to feel that way. But I slipped, I fell. Nobody pulled me back up, because nobody cares. Now I realised that the day was gloomy and I'm free. It feels like the landslide is soaking and trembling particles of dust away with rainwater, now I'm in a dark creek. My mouth is taped shut, and my head is just above the surface. All I can feel is sadness and abandonment while rain drops sparkle on me. Never seeing the true light of the day that others will admire. Now it's quiet, dark, numb, and peaceful. If this was reality, and I was unconscious, the pain would end. A commitment to suicide is a commitment to realism. I would never feel pain again if that happened. A true, unconscious meaningful daydream of peace. This is how I feel.",AdvertisingIcy9222,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12dfxtn/life_making_friends/
My IQ is really low and there is something wrong with me what do I do?,"So let me tell you a few things about me, and let me know what you think.

 Maladaptive daydreaming disorder I am 99.999% sure that I have it. I have multiple other realities that live in my head and I'm not sure I fully understand some of them all. There is one where I am a loving father with two kids that I love immensely, (I don't want kids so what the heck?) in another I am a successful man have my own crib and have a great sense of humor and a lot of charisma(babe magnet).most are based on fantasy tho as I play a lot of games, sometimes the plots are so sad I cry from them, yup that's right, I can  actually make myself cry from them.

1. I'm pretty dumb, I'm 27 live with my mom, have done nothing with my life after high school. All the jobs I've worked at except for maybe one I have shown people how dumb I am, I can never concentrate some jobs call me lazy because I'm always out of it others call me hard working because I focus, don't talk and do my work it depends on what the jobs are. never had a girlfriend, I only have 2 more years left so I never will, but it's not because of my looks though I'm my opinion I don't look to bad I'm I'd say I'm a clean 7, it's because of me really I have no game I am just a low value person and that is on me.
2. I hate myself, like a lot, I have a bad habit of saying it out load when I think no when can hear me, it's so bad that I just otter it out, things like ""I hate myself"" ""can't wait to die"" I know my brothers have heard me sometimes I can hear them pressed up on my door, must think I'm crazy, I also talk to myself all the time as well. I have a hard time sleeping I also have a problem where I wake up but my body is still asleep, I can't move I try to scream but can't.
3. My self hate is so bad I even hate the race I was born as (black) I spend a lot of time on twitter it's where I get my news and I constantly see racism, like the real bad stuff People calling me sh\*t skin, sub human, and I think to myself and I'm like ehhh sure, your probably right, it's how I cope, can't help my self reading it sometimes tho I try to stop because my mind isn't on my side it will randomly bring it up later, want really hurts me is the hate that comes from black women that hate us, I feel so bad about it because it's other black man that made them feel that way, it's like a circle of hate, they deserve better we all do.   

This is just the tip of the iceberg if you bothered to read all that. Please bare with me I am an idiot so this is all over the place, what am I supposed to do? I'm too dumb to get a nice paying job everything I try will fail, I'm pretty sure I learning disorder or I'm just dumb, please some one, anyone help me.",Thereen26,18,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12cmyf2/my_iq_is_really_low_and_there_is_something_wrong/
“You aren’t depressed you are asking for attention”,That is what someone told me when I posted on my story about how bad my depression has become these past months I have diagnosed depression and it did get extremely bad I lost my job because of it my house is a mess I stopped eating I stopped doing tasks it was a really hard time and I just needed to vent somewhere I didn’t write too much I just explained that it’s very hard dealing with depression as a young adult who has adult responsibilities to also look after. I wasn’t looking for attention because I just wanted to vent I also posted it on a private story but I allowed some people to join by clicking on the join my story option on snap. They sent that and I asked why do they believe this if they don’t know me personally? They said because I’m too attractive to have a mental illness and I’m definitely one of those girls who say they have it to get attention from men. What? I just needed to vent because I didn’t know what else to do I didn’t care if no one saw it. I didn’t dnt respond to them because I didn’t nt think it was necessary to keep the conversation going but it did hurt. Just because I’m “attractive” which I don’t believe because I’m very insecure tbh doesn’t mean I can’t be depressed idk I just didn’t understand it. I’m not mean to anyone I don’t talk to anyone besides my two best friends and my bf I keep to myself so idk who this girl was to say that but oh well I guess I just wanted to say something about this,Sugar_darlin,15,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12cu6jb/you_arent_depressed_you_are_asking_for_attention/

Can't Sleep,"In about two hours, I'm dragging myself outside to get bloodwork done that should have been done months ago. I tried once and was turned away because I had drank a Gatorade Zero the night before. My mom(a former nurse) had told me it was fine.

When they turned me away, I sighed and looked upwards like it was the greatest inconvenience in the world. I was clearly upset. I left and got in my car, but then I got back out and went back to the desk. I told the techs that I wasn't mad at them, I was just frustrated with myself. They looked at me like I had six heads. I'm so fucking weird and I've been too embarrassed to go back and get the work done.

Meanwhile, I'm here in bed...and all I want is my ex. I miss her so goddamn much. She left because I was too depressed and for the last ten months, I've tried different things to fix myself. None of them have worked. I stalled in my Google Certificate course. TMS didn't help. New meds didn't help.

Everything hurts because it all reminds me of her. I just miss her but I know being with me was unfair to her. I just want to be fixed. I want to show her I'm better. But I'm not. And I'm just here, in the dark, typing into the reddit void because I can't sleep.

It's pathetic. I was on a management track where I used to work, where I met her, and I got fired because of a coworker. I've had no confidence ever since. I tried another job in a similar field and all it did was make me come home and cry every night.

Two years she put up with me not having a job, keeping the same medication and being too afraid to try TMS or something else. Now she's gone and it's all my fucking fault.

All I want is to fix things, but I can't find a job I believe I can do, and I keep having nights like tonight where I can't sleep. It hurts. It hurts so goddamn much and it's so stupid that I can't just grab a job and feel better. It's so stupid I can't find joy anymore.

It's not fair. I found the love of my life and I ruined it. I fucking ruined everything. All I've ever wanted since I was a kid was to have a special someone and I fucked it up.

Don’t feel like I want to see tomorrow,"I just graduated high school and started university. My whole friend group of 2 years, who had made me feel finally complete after spending the 2 years prior to that alone at boarding school, left me with no warning as to why. They just outgrew me, never told me why they didn’t want to be around me anymore.
My two loves are music and film and I was really thriving in those things at some point until one day it was just suddenly taken from me. No one wanted to work with me anymore and my band, which I dedicated all my love and time to, broke up and was never spoken of.
My best friend at the time was basically shunned and I never saw him again. He turned out to not be who I thought he was and that destroyed me. 
I grew up around people disappointing me and having my small bouts of hope and development taken from me, never letting me actually discover myself. My parents cheated relentlessly and I was always in the middle of it, being uprooted and taken to new houses sometimes twice a year. I was never really ‘happy’. Just kind of live day by day and always thought that was normal until I realised some people actually wake up excited to go into the world. 
After everything has happened to me I’ve reached a point in my life where I have 0 friends, I’ve gained heaps of weight, I’m doing a degree blindly never really showing any interest, me and my boyfriends relationship is getting rockier everyday, work is draining, family is losing respect for me. 
I just don’t really see the point of getting up and doing everything again tomorrow - I’ve been waiting 18 years to feel something except empty but everyday that feels even more out of my reach. 
I have no one to turn to and no one that can really help me. My boyfriend is Christian and I was raised pretty much agnostic which puts a barrier between us that makes reaching out difficult, as I often don’t want to be told to pray to feel better as it has never worked before.

I don’t expect anyone to read to the end and I’m sorry for dumping my whole life story I just have no one to tell about how much I’m slipping every day. 
I’ve lost interest in every hobby I was so in love with before and now contribute nothing to anything. Im useless and completely alone.

Tired of trying to relate to a world that won't listen,"Just one lonely guy among many in this world. I feel like venting. It's not that my life is the worst or that life is pointless. But I have grown increasingly aware and learned in how the world works and I've been trying to build bridges by pointing out both myself and the other party can learn and move forward. But lately most of the people I talk to in person either don't understand or miss the point entirely. So many times it has all fallen on me to be the guy to admit the error and own up to everything. Which I do quite a lot. But the world can't and shouldn't work that way. Responding to legitimate, thoughtful reasoning does not mean I'm just playing the victim here.

That sort of response is better reserved for someone trying to justify a crime, which I'm not. I am not wallowing in self pity here, I AM trying to relate and seek a solution. If no one's going to care enough to see the genuine emotional struggle I'm in, why should I listen to their ""toughen up"" malarkey? The best healing I've seen comes from empathy and listening to those in pain.

But today, here and now, after a disastrous attempt yesterday, I feel like I am against the world. Alone and bitter, because I try hard to connect, but it just keeps blowing up in my face.

I broke myself and I keep dropping the peices,"This is a long post. Be warned, but thank you for reading. Strangers you cant see are always the easiest to talk to. I can write too much sometimes so skip to the break if you dont like context

So for context im 19(almost 20), a guy, and lived in extreme poverty for all except the last 4 years. I have spent most of my time working since i was 13, as it was pleasant escape for my situation. That demeanor hasn't ever changed and i grew to really enjoy my career as a machinist. I landed a really nice paying job with little effort straight out of highschool, moving me into the city as well (was in a town of 650-700 before).
After working there for about a year, i wanted to change jobs to have more control over the machines. The corperate job i was at would only let 1 person do anything other than hit start. Landed another job doing carbon fiber and got to working. This brings us to the beginning of my reckoning:

Mid october of last year(2022), i tried shrooms for the second time. Only problem being that both times i took 7g's while only weighing 115-120lbs. The first time was in june for my birthday, but there were no noticeable after effects; went on with the job change as i planned with no problems. The second time however, i did equal with my buddy but felt like i HAD to put myself in my room alone. Proceeded to have the worst time imaginable, trapped in the ptsd i worked so hard to get rid of. After my friend left i noticed i was lagging a little bit but didnt think much of it since, well, i just took pychs.
Then the weekend passed and i had to go to work. But i didnt. I couldnt even get myself out of my bed. I was so unmotivated to go to the job i JUST landed, that had so many opportunities waiting. I kept telling myself to leave but even if i made it to the door i would just pace around my living room until i went back to bed. The next day came and i did it again. Then again, and again. Until of course i got fired for not showing up for the whole week.
By that point i had no obligations anymore so i just stayed in the house and smoked weed to my hearts content. Unfortunately it would never be content, only consuming instead. I never had to pay for it myself so i never really cared either. 
I proceeded to completely isolate and basically starve myself over the next 5 months, reaching a nice healthy weight of 103lb. If i left the house it would only to be to move my car to the other side of the road because of our emergency snow route law. Sometimes i couldnt even do that and i would end up with a $40 ticket.
By december i was completely out of money, and started taking loans from nearly everyone i know. I am very lucky for supportive peers and i love them all. I know i owe thousands now, i can only hope they will continue to be patient with me.
Even with all ive taken though, i could never get anything started. Every attempt i made just ended with.... well nothing. I spend every minute im not actively doing something thinking of all the ways i can fix my situation. But nothing ever happens. I go to the door to try and doordash, the same pacing happens. I think ive gotten to the point where its not that i dont want to do it anymore, lazyness, its more that im scared of people.
Im scared that im out of place, that im not sociable enough to be in public. Even though most people are so focused on their own lives they wont even notice others. Im scared im going to screw something up no matter how difficult it would be. Or that i already have screwed it up and theres no point in trying since.
I dont know what ""it"" is. I dont understand how i can go from loving work, meeting new people, traveling, dating, and college; to this. A hunched boy with more bones showing than skin, glued to a tv or phone, ignoring the hunger pains because its so much easier not to eat.
I dont want to live like this anymore. I dont want to be alone anymore. I never did in the first place. I already had to, theres no reason to again. I thought in march i hit my breaking point and started to sober up. Withdrawls were terrible and there were many nights of no sleep. I started to feel better and got really hopeful. I even went to the mall with someone a few weeks ago and actually smiled and laughed with people! I forgot what that felt like. 
Unfortunately i dont know how to say no to free bud so when it was given, i took. Then everything stopped. I spent the next ~2 weeks just as i had before sobering. Lagged on the couch, refusing to do anything. This last weekend i ran myself out so i physically couldnt use. I want to do better. I want to pay everyone back. Its all i want. But i still cant. Everytime i try something stops me. I dont know what it is. Its so frustrating to watch everything i built for myself go down the drain so quickly. That in itself is enough to unmotivate.
During this there were many times i gave up, truely okay with my fate and was ready to pack up and bite the bullet. I dont know what stopped me. I told no one, i gave no one nothing. There were no voices to tell me to stop, only the one to tell me to. Perhaps it was the same reason as with leaving the house. Maybe i was scared id find a way to mess that up too.
I no longer feel this way though. I have no want for death, only to improve myself, as futile as the attempts may be. I still cannot leave my apartment except for menial things like garbage(which was neglected prior dont get me wrong) or the car, nor eat or even feel hungry. I have pain in my bones as im sure my muscles are atrofying. 
As i lay here writing this on my phone, i can only think of what i will do tomorrow. I can only hope i can win that battle. I have dug myself quite the hole, it will be a pain to dig back out of. But i am determined, and ready for challenge. I will continue to push back as hard as i can so i dont have to later.
I love you all even if i hate myself. Thank you, and goodnight dear reader.",Skemiet2,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12dcr9x/i_broke_myself_and_i_keep_dropping_the_peices/

Why do I feel more disappointed in myself than ever. (15M),"I feel more depressed, I feel more useless than ever. I can never seem to get anything right. Everyday it’s the same things from my parents “Why did you get a 30% on your test” “Why did you get a bad score on your homework” Like i’m trying mom i’m trying really hard but it seems you only care for the score and how long it takes me to complete the assignment. I only have 1 real friend and i’m leaving for vacation next monday. I ask my friend hey do you wanna hangout before i leave he’s like “I can’t i’m hanging out with my gf” So i asked him the next day “hey so you wanna chill” he responds with “Can’t i’m with my gf, we’re hanging out the rest of the week, sorry we didn’t plan anything”. Like i’m sorry i didn’t know we had to plan a week prior to hangout. It’s been like this every day all week every week. The only time we hangout is saturday and that’s if he’s not with his gf. I don’t know what to really do i can’t make new friends because i’m homeschooled because i smoked a little weed. Like i’m sorry but remember when you let my brother (17M) YOUR SON smoke weed whenever he wanted because he was depressed. I smoked because i was depressed and wanted some sort of happiness.

At this point I washed my hair to do graduation pictures but normally use dry shampoo spray to keep it from looking too bad
It's not the normal get in and never want to leave.

It's a struggle and I have to force myself to finally do it at the end of the week. I've gotten used to looking homeless and unkempt. I don't know what to do.

My social anxiety keeps me from going longer without a shower but I never find the energy to shower willingly. 

I've listened to my therapist about setting alarms, it maybe worked for 2 weeks before I just shut them off. 

I don't know what to do. I hate looking bald and I know the rest of my body needs cared for. I've tried self care, lotions, tips and tricks but I don't have will to do them. I just want to sleep and eat.

Im getting tired of living,"Each year as I get older and older I just keep getting more and more illnesses. I have an incurable disease, terrible and painful and incurable eye condition, bad teeth somehow even though I brush daily, bad blood reports, and so much mental illness. I’ve struggled with body image ever since i was a kid and developed anorexia at 16. Im spiralling because during Ramadan I always end up gaining weight funnily enough and every time I body check I get distraught. So far I’ve been deluding myself by thinking I’ll just eat less or I’ll starve it all off after this month but i dont know how much longer I can take it. Im so paranoid of anything and everything I cannot even leave my house without having every single possible scenario of me dying in some way every single second. And right now I’m most paranoid about going blind as I am in pain in my eyes. So much so I’ve already began mentally preparing myself if I go blind, it’s not likely but anything could happen with my luck. Not only that, I have terrible anxiety over everything and bad social anxiety. I cant make friends no matter how hard I try. Every time I hear my classmates talking and laughing I cry a bit in the back of the class. And to my delight, I found out a big reason why I’m so anxious and deathly paranoid is because of my disease, how unlucky I am that my incurable disease has side affects that makes me more paranoid and anxious. Im on so much medication, and I still need more medication. My mom does not take my attention deficit disorder seriously and I desperately need pills for it because I’m having such a hard time focusing at school. Everyday at least once I think why live? Im already suicidal for other reasons and my health is now my biggest reason. In my religion we are not allowed to kill ourself and I think that’s the only reason why I’m alive right now. Every day I just want to die, im deathly afraid for my future knowing that I just keep getting sicker and sicker. What’s the point in living then? Life cannot be enjoyable in pain and I do not want to go through it. I wouldn’t mind if i dont wake up the next day often. Im just going to be living in pain and suffering. I want to graduate college, get married have kids but it really feels like I’ll never get to enjoy life happily and pain less. I feel too scared talking about this with a therapist or even to my friends and family so I’m rambling on here. Im sorry i just couldn’t stop crying through my prayer and wanted to get it off my chest. I guess I want to hear comforting words, and if it gets better for people like me with my health issues.",imthat1boyo,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12d3mx1/im_getting_tired_of_living/

Feeling depressed after the death of a parent,"Recently i've lost a parent and i'm having a hard time continuing my life.

i have gone back to work. I do have moments where i dont think of it and can talk to my coworkers but then i would feel guilty for forgetting for a bit what has happened recently. Other moments i get this feeling of hopelessness and anxious feeling of getting scared i would never feel happy again and everything will go downhill. The feeling gets so strong which makes it hard to live. This feeling comes and goes but i feel alone of dealing with it myself. i have a hard time explaining to my friend how i'm feeling because i make myself believe that they wont understand and i would look too broken and that they will leave me. I fear really badly that the ones i love in my life will leave. I have read how i should try not to give in to the feeling but it's winning most of the time. i dont know what else to do. i do see a therapist every week or 2nd week but i'm starting to feel like its not working and blaming myself for not getting better since i think he's a good therapist. i feel like my friends are hard to reach but maybe its also me who are worrying too much about being too much for them. im not good at asking for help to my friends.

i would say that i'm depressed but maybe i'm looking like i'm doing fine. i only went back to work because i must earn money and in this way, i wouldnt look like i have completely lost myself to others but i'm feeling fucked up in my head because of this death. i dont believe any good things will happen in my life anymore, only bad stuff.

the thing i hate the most, is how bad i am to articulate my feelings because when i sometimes try to, i cant find the word and i get frustrated, feeling stupid and thinking what im feeling, is not valid.

i'm been thinking about trying to write and understand my feelings and also get better at expressing myself to others because i feel very alone

My stepmom decided to bring my meds down a dosage because I slept past my alarm a few times.,"My stepmom is an absolute psychopath first of all. I’ve had diagnosed major depressive disorder since age 9, and I am currently 14 years old. I recently got put on some antidepressants (just 10mg to start) and everything was fine. I had begun to show mild signs of improvement as time went on. Then more recently, they were upped by a lot when I told the doctor that I really hadn’t noticed a huge amount of change as I had hoped. The only issue is that they make me very tired. I am unable to wake up some mornings because when I turn my alarm off, I tend to pass out immediately afterwards without meaning to. So this happened a few days for the past 2 weeks, and she decided to claim that she was going to “take them away” from me if i didn’t start waking up. I come home to find she has changed my med plan herself and is only now allowing me to take 10mg again.

I don’t know what I’m supposed to be doing,"I don’t think I’m a good mother. I don’t think I’m a good wife. My house is a mess. My bank account is empty. My bills are piling up. My lights will be off at some point soon. 

My son is having problems at school, I’m trying to fix it, but it’s just so much I can do. He tells me his teachers hate him, he’s on in kindergarten and he thinks his teachers dislike him. So I’m enrolling him in a different school. Work makes it hard for me to spend quality time with my son, a day off means no money. Being sick means no money, so no days off. Im not a good wife, because my house is a mess, I barely have time to cook, and I’m rarely in the mood. 

2022 was a pretty good year for me; I self published my first book, I started a nerdy women’s group, I got my first car (I’m in my early 30s), I hit my 2 year milestone at my job, I met a bunch of astronauts, and I got my associates degree. Work didn’t pay well, but it allowed me to experience things I would never experience. I decided to get my degree to try and get a raise at my company, but that didn’t work. Maybe I wasted my time. I’ve tried finding a different job, but my inbox is filled with a lot of “Thank you for applying, but…” and I don’t know if I will ever make enough to just take care of the essentials. I’m not trying to make enough to “self-care”, I just want to make enough to feed my son, clothe him, buy health insurance, and get him swimming lessons. I have cried at my desk a lot this year. 

2023 was the year I lost my hero, my grandmother. She would call me and check on me every week. I would get on a two hour bus ride to sit with her. The only people I could call on and know they would be there, that they would pick up, they’re dead. I miss their voices. One was the most fun, coolest chick that I loved being around.

Nothing ever goes my way,"[throwaway account]
I’m a 21M junior in college and I feel like no matter how much effort I put into anything in my life I don’t get anywhere.

I just got cut from my college team that I have been a part of for 3 years after my coach said I was ‘not meeting athletic performance standards.’  I worked my ass off day in and day out for over 20 hours a week, and my former teammates all think that me being cut was totally unfair.  This has kind of been a breaking point for me because sport was my biggest source of stability in my life, and something I could always work hard in if something else wasn’t going my way.

I work really hard with my schoolwork, I’m ADHD so it’s hard, but I study all that I can and my GPA is still shit no matter what I try and how long I try it for.

I’m currently trying to find a job or an internship, and have been trying for a couple months now, and I’m hardly getting a response back from any of the unfathomably large amount of companies and labs that I have applied to, much less an offer.

I do have a wonderful girlfriend that I wouldn’t trade for the world so I do have that going for me.  She’s such successful person and she loves me so much, but I feel like if things keep going this way in my life I’m going to bring her down.

"I am deteriorating, meds are not helping, the mood swings are unbearable.","It all stemmed from an extremely hard breakup with a narcissist. So many mind games, lies, breadcrumbing she did. It's a long story in itself but it left me traumatized a triggered my mental illness back to the extreme. I believe after talking to doctors that I may have borderline personality disorder. I dealt with depression, anxiety and abandonment issues my entire life. We broke up in fucking June last year, with no closure and breadcrumbing, lies and mindgames sooo much and I still cannot be happy, she ghosted me in November after us knowing each other for yeaaaars and made HORRIBLE lies about me.  I went on dates, I've slept with people I find attractive. And I just go home and cry so much about this girl. She did many horrible things to me, but I wanted to marry her someday. I feel so fucking alone like everyone hates me, I didn't hang out with my friends as much when I was dating her.

At the same time, I also do not want to go out and do things when I am invited, It is a vicious cycle. I got prescribed medication back in November and its not getting better, sometimes I think I am but I can be totally fine, motivated and happy one moment, and then feel absolute dread and agony the next. I am not at the point of suicide, but I am just so so so tired. I stopped going to the gym in January, and I hate it because I made soooo much progress for the past year I went, I am just watching all the muscle and gains I made deteriate before my eyes. I just have zero energy or will to leave the house. I almost blame the medication for this, not helping the anguish I have in my head. AND making me not do the bare minimum of going to the gym for 45 minutes a day like I was. I am on Wellbutrin, Zoloft, Buspar, Vyvanse. I am just so tired.....

Tough Day,"Hello,  I am new to this page and fairly new to Reddit. Not new to depression by any means though. Just reaching out because today feels rougher than one I've had in recent months (though maybe that's not true) I have some big stressors coming up:

1. Birthday (and no one to spend it with, again)
2. Moving apartments (out of need, not so much want--and its ROUGH out there finding anything affordable that isn't a slum)
3. Have a chest infection and maybe fever? + my period is starting, so just very run down
4. My fav coworker got laid off very suddenly today and I suspect I may not be far behind.The prospect of signing a lease not knowing if I'll have a job in a couple months is terrifying to me.
5. I don't really have anywhere to go. I  have no siblings and my parent, who I am fairly close with have a boarder in their home since they are still renting (long story) so  there is not really any  space for me when I visit. This is constant underlying source of stress since they are aging and have no housing stability either. 

Anyhow, I'm quickly approaching my mid 40s and this is NOT where I envisioned I'd be at this age. I had long term partners, but nothing panned out. I had to move away (out of state) because I was priced out of my hometown. Quickly becoming priced out here too. I miss my parents terribly but moving back to where I am from is economically not feasible. I have a couple friends here, but they are both newer and so it feels tenuous--not like the comfort of family or old friendships. I have old friendships I maintain long-distance,but this doesn't change the fact that I spend most of my time alone  (work from home now too.) Most days I can roll with the punches and find reason for keeping on in the small stuff (the  wind in the trees, the sounds of birds) but today is  not one of those days. Feel so lost and alone and honestly afraid for my future. Just thought I'd try reaching out. 

I have no stability in my life and I don't see that changing anytime soon despite my many efforts (master's degree among other things) I'm just....scared. Anyhow, thanks for listening. Not really sure if this is the right place to post about this but thought I'd try.",accidentalrorschach,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12d354d/tough_day/

Feels like I fell off the face of the Earth…,"I’ve had a very up and down life in terms of my mental health. I was diagnosed with clinical depression and GAD when I was 11 and have been on meds ever since. Middle school and high school were some of the best years of my life and I had a lot of friends. I met the girl I thought would be my wife as a junior in high school. We dated for four years and ended up just breaking up in January due to different career paths. I am 21 now and feel lost. I feel like I don’t know anyone anymore, and lost my ability to meet new people. My girlfriend and I spent countless time together which caused me to lose a lot of those friendships I had other than the ones who were close to me. When the COVID pandemic first hit my Instagram got hacked and I lost everything including my account. I didn’t feel the need to restart it, or get on any other social media because I had my close group of friends and a stable relationship with my girlfriend at the time. Having barely any social media presence makes me feel like I can’t connect with anyone, and like I’m an outsider considering almost everyone my age has it. I feel like it is too late to restart it now.

This upcoming summer I will be moving half way across the country for an internship. This scares me because if I already feel alone with the small group of friends I have now, what will happen when I move that far away and know nobody with no way to make connections online. I just feel lost and don’t know what to do.

Words for which I am ashamed,"
Hi? 
Thoughts of suicide have been haunting me for a long time, the most annoying thing is that they appear spontaneously when I'm doing my own business. At night I fall asleep with the thought: ""Maybe it's better for me to die?""
I explain. I simply have no reason to commit suicide. I have friends, a normal relationship with my parents, I absolutely don't care about my appearance, but for some reason I want to die. It's too hard for me. I literally feel that this life is crushing me, and I'm too weak to fight it somehow. It seems to me that I won't achieve anything in this life, and if you haven't achieved anything in life, then why live? I can't bring myself to go to spci in any way, is something constantly bothering me or am I bothering myself again?",Upstairs_Midnight508,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12d2hho/words_for_which_i_am_ashamed/
Why can’t I feel anything?,"I don’t even know if this is the appropriate subreddit, I don’t even know how to put my feelings into words, but here goes:

 Today, my gf and I officially separated. After weeks of arguing, her breaking down in my car countless times, and me kicking her out of my house on numerous occasions it finally ended today. I loved her, she loved me. For her, I was everything, her only friend, her lover, someone and perhaps the only one she could comfortably confide in. The relationship wasn’t perfect, we argued/fought, I was a sarcastic asshole, she would get physical, I would forgive her and we’d get over it. Monday after arguing over her libido and my lack of an ability to please her as much as she liked I decided to end it. It was horrible the sounds she made upon making my decision, you’d have thought I murdered her cats. I couldn’t shed a tear though, not one. I kicked her out, she ran off,  I presumed to endlessly scroll on Instagram laughing away at memes. Eventually she’d come back and would later tell me she sat at a bridge contemplating suicide, I didn’t feel anything, not even remorse, not guilt, nothing, after this she’d proceed to breakdown again, still nothing... Unrelated but an uncle passed away recently (2 weeks ago), reunited with my siblings, and father after half a decade, no tears. Today I feel nothing, writing this I feel nothing. I feel dead inside, expressionless, emotionless, empty. And when I do feel anything, like a cold breeze on a hot, sunny day, it is gone in a instant. 


 In my heart I love her, but I don’t think I care anymore, for anything really. I just want to cry or feel anything but I physically cant.  What’s wrong with me?

I'm so done tell me what drugs work please,"25M. I'm taking escitlopram for depression/GAD/IBS 20mg It barely works and I'm taking 5mg valium at night(stopped working gonna bump up to 10). I have ADHD and take ritilin to actually gtfu and it still doesn't work it just keeps me awake but I lay in bed depressed still. My story would be wayy too long so tldr is I have a family which I love so much but underappriciate me. I know that without me they would be so fucking lost. I literally fix at least 1 major fuck up a day. This week alone I've gotten my sibling out of being suspended, filled in forms up to my nose. I CBF even typing everything.  What's funny is I'm so against drugs I literally know the dangers but I DGAF anymore. I was ready to go a year ago, was in hospital for a week because of gastrointestinal issues that no doctor could solve which had been ongoing for 5 years. Imagine constant nausea and cramps of you don't eat it's bad and if you eat it's hell. Eating would take me out for the day so I'd leave it till night and just lay fetal in pain all night. I was in hospital crying because I knew how fucked they'd be without me and the pain I'd cause so I started doing voice notes, hours worth getting ready. I had everything sorted. I got discharged and went on a walk daily to my favourite park which is right next to a cemetery. I love it weirdly. Put music on and go past the dead wondering who they were. I was ready to go but then started taking valium more and higher dose. It literally saved me. My doctor put me on antidepressants. But the valium saved my life in the mean time till they kicked in. Even rn I feel like valium and ritilin are why I'm functioning. I don't even wanna run away. I have no heavy morals anymore I mean I will not harm innocent people or steal from the poor. That's it but greedy mfs like Bezos is done for if I see him. I know that I stay on this path I'm gonna be in jail or dead. And I'm already at a phase where I'm wishing someone would test me. My question is what drug works. Idc wtf it is . But what drug will remove all nausea make me happy and not depressed.

Paroxetine withdrawal,"If this is incoherent, that's because it's 4:30am and I feel like hell.

I'm coming off 30mg paroxetine and straight into 20mg fluoxetine (prozac) as directed by my GP. No slow taper, just straight switch, and oh my god this is torture. I've done cold turkey switches from other SSRI's and they were all fine, if anything they were kind of fun. But this? Pure evil.

I feel alone and unwanted.,"Having aspergers has always been hard on me because I'm not like the other ""normal"" people, but rather one of the undesirables. 

For starters, I've always had trouble gaining different employment other than the job I currently have, and lately I've been trying to gain a position in IT where I currently work just by moving up in the ladder. I've studied for IT and even got my ITF+ but I have a feeling that I won't get hired even though a college degree isn't even required. I feel this way because I've applied to different jobs before and no one would take me. And the only reason why i got my current job is because my grandmother used to work there before she retired and put in a good word for me, otherwise my application would of been thrown out.

 I've also started to get back into the dating scene by going on dating apps and I'm already starting to doubt that I'll find someone. The reason being is because I don't feel like I would be a very good candidate for a date due to either rejection in the past and past relationships that didn't last long. The longest relationship I've had was 5 months and that was with my first girlfriend in high-school. Plus I have lack of sexual experience, strange fetishes, and I suspect that I might have ED. 

Another thing is that I feel like my friends or family couldn't care less if I even existed because it seems like I have to initiate the conversation for the most part but hardly any of my friends or family get a hold of me. Some of the family members I know want nothing to do with me anyways including my siblings. And I have a feeling that some of my so called friends don't want anything to do with me either. 

I'm also an independent musician who has a bandcamp page (which I will not share because I want to remain anonymous here.), and have produced music for well over 10 years but didn't get the recognition I wanted and literaly no income from doing what I love most.

So what does all this have to do with autism? Well it's the fact that we aspies have poor social skills and it can be difficult to create or maintain relationships, whether it be romantic, professional, or anything platonic. And it seems like everytime I try to improve myself regarding those things it becomes a wasted effort. As if I'm not even welcome here in this world.

 I honestly don't know why I even bother try to do anything anymore, because it doesn't seem like I'm getting anywhere in life. But I guess I'll continue to preform the mental gymnastics that something will change for the better, but I already know they won't. I live alone in a subsidized housing program, I have a job that I don't like at all,  and I have the strong desire to consume drugs and alcohol, and everything I do ends up being a failure. I've pretty much come to the conclusion that my life Isn't going to encompass anything more than that. I feel like my life is one cruel joke, and I'm not sure how much longer I'm going to take this before inevitably committing suicide in the future. I honestly don't have a whole lot I can give to this world, and I don't see why I should be a part of it.",Randomguy_93,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12cw14b/i_feel_alone_and_unwanted/

I've run out of hope,"25 years old M, just graduated university today. It's a day I always imagined would be the happiest day of my life. I've been holding back tears all day. I think I've been suffering from depression for a few years now, at least the therapist I saw a few years ago said I was showing symptoms. I've never voiced what I'm about to say out loud, because I have absolutely no one in my life who I can open up to. I don't even know what I expect to hear back hear, but I just need to get this out.

I feel like I've reached the end of my life, I see no hope. I'm about to head into the workforce and expected to be a functional adult, but I feel like I missed out on major life milestones. I've never been in a relationship. I've completely failed to form friendships with anyone at university. The friends I do have from before, we've slowly grown apart and see each other only maybe once a month, and they are the ""bro"" kinda friends. I didn't make an effort to do all these things; I was too focused on schoolwork, and by nature shy and withdrawn enough to let opportunities to meet others pass me by. I completely failed to make meaningful emotional relationships with others.

I've carried this low self-esteem and confidence my whole life, and it's the root of all of my suffering. Always afraid of being judged, of walking up to a girl to say hi, of asking a friend to hang out first. I've realized how badly I fucked up my life, and made an effort to change all these parts of my personality in my last year, but it was too late and I still failed. Now all the opportunities to meet new people and form friendships and relationships are going to be exponentially harder, and I am so behind everyone else. I don't feel ready. It hurts knowing I don't have the same experiences a normal person should have at my age. I don't see any point in living without these things in my life, and I don't see how I can fix things at this point. I can already see my future: work 9-5, come home, have dinner by myself, play video games, and go to sleep. The only comforting thought I have to calm myself with is telling myself I'll eventually just end it all. I'm running out of ways out.

In general, my life is changing so fast, and it hurts. I'm losing touch with my family as well. My brothers moved to different cities for work, and it seems I will have to as well. My parents are getting older, I'm losing grandparents. I know I need to move on, but because of how much I've missed out on, I find it hard to.

I am afraid to be honest about my thoughts with anyone irl because I am ashamed of how I feel and don't want to risk being hospitalized or anything.",JustinianIV,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12d0lgb/ive_run_out_of_hope/
Am I having mild serotonin syndrome???,"My physiatrist just switched me from Zoloft to Lexipro because I was not sleeping well and having nightmares. I’ve been taking it for two days now and I feel exhausted, sluggish, irritated at every small thing, I just feel like crying, my heart is pounding like crazy, and I just overall feel awful like I’m not really here and I have no drive to do anything. I just don’t really know what to do right now. I’m not sure if I should just wait it out and it will pass or I should I stop taking it all together. I’m just exhausted and I’m so tired of all of this.

I don't know what to do anymore,"I'm 19 and am dealing with depression since I was 14. It all started when my disabled younger cousin died at the age of 11. He looked like a live skeleton who is almost brain dead as far as I can remember. We tried everything we could to help him and reduce his pain, none ever worked. We lived as a joint family so he was like my younger brother whom I looked after growing up. He always looked liked he lives in pain, not being able to do anything but cry in pain, not being able to control his bodily functions. He couldn't respond to like anything but there are times when he smiles and it felt like my duty to make him smile. One day after I came from school to go tell him all about it to see if he could react to me talking and all I was met with was my crying parents and aunt(his mom) while everyone else was standing next to his crib in silence trying to hold back, I was 14 and all I could think of was that either my grandma or my mom had a serious injury but after seeing thag everyone were physically ok I went to see the crib and found my cousin sleeping and was saying to everyone there to be silent or he may wake up. I had an inkling of what happened but was trying to deny it desperately only for naught, this happened within the time when aunt went to see the stove and uncle was washing his face. All I could do was cry and run away from there as far as I can.

Next thing I realised was that 6 months passed without me knowing and I was 15.
I met a guy who was 18 in a tution and he used be like the senior who would look after you as a brother. We used to hang out and I was depending on him a lot that when he told me smoking helps to escape from sadness I trusted his word and started smoking cigarettes, weed and alcohol. I became an alcoholic drinking from morning to night in secret with him and spent a whole year like that. 

One day when we both were completely drunk my classmate called me to check if I was ok but I was blacked out so he picked up the call and started blaring all types of verbal abuses a 15yr old girl can't even imagine and cut the call. The next day in school I went to see her after noticing the call log that morning and she slapped me so hard that my lips bled and everyone whom I thought were my friends were staring at me coldly for reasons I didn't know at that time. This was the start of me being bullied in my final school year in that school. I felt betrayed by people whom I thought as friends for the last 13 yrs of school suddenly started treating me like a criminal when I was the victim and nobody was by my side by then to listen to me. I felt like all of things we did as friends for all my school life amounts to nothing in front of a false accusation and all the trust I had in people became my reason for crying every night. School was over before I realised anything other than crying and pain, I was smoking every cigarette I could get my hands on and drank all I could at that time. Only memories I have of that time are me drinking, smoking and my attempts to kill myself. 

I don't know what happened on my 16th birthday or what I did until I turned 16. My parents thought to help me by getting me to get therapy and rehab. They couldn't do anything as I was doing all this except to cry after seeing my pathetic state. When I went to see the psychiatrist to get help all he did was lock me in a room for 3 months and give me shock treatment once every two weeks. I was discharged with no change in my mental state or my addictions, my parents tried to send to another rehab for 2 months in another state but all that was there for me was more bullying by my fellow rehab patients as they were jealous of me as my parents were with me almost all day except when have to leave the centre. I was discharged from there with more scars instead of help. 

We came back to our home and my mom, dad and sis, we moved to another town to not make me meet my classmates who bullied me and the senior who introduced smoking, drinking and weed to me. We stayed there for 3 yrs, my dad was worried about me the whole time and couldn't go to the meeting he should go to get a new work and my mom did some architecture planning to houses to get food for us to eat. I refused to go out of my room, refused to talk to people or even my mom, dad or sis as felt like they were the reason for me being bullied in the rehab. When I started to think to myself about how wrong am I about that decision I took that day, it hit me that they were the ones suffering for me wallowing in self pity for years and all they could do was cry just like I did. I felt worthless, I still feel worthless as a son and brother and can't even face my family properly now.

I forget how to talk sometimes and I feel like I'm talking to a stranger when I'm talking to my sister and dad and I can't properly see my mom's face since then. I feel like what I'm doing is a waste of time but I don't know what to do with my life, how to be better as a son and a brother and how to live my life.

I feel like I don't have the right to get help after all I did, it feels like everything is my fault, it's my fault that my family became worse as the day passes, I don't feel like I have the right to be loved or the right to be happy.",juzousuzu,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12d62q8/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/
Don’t wanna ruin your day but..,"So I had the sad realization today that between the ages of 35 and 40 you’re already halfway through your life for the average life expectancy. On top of my life long depression, and me being almost 34 never married with no kids. I feel like I wasted the best part of my life already and sadly for the majority of it getting high! Now I’m sober but at this point until I meet someone, and trust them enough to maybe have a child, it’s already gonna be too late. It’s been real hard lately for me to deal with that realization, and have will to even stay sober on top of it. Deep down I know that can’t be an option and will only make it better temporarily and then much worse eventually!

Antidepressants + Eating Disorder,"Hey all! 

Hope you are all doing well. This is probably the wrong forum to post on but I value your opinions since it seems we all share a common feat 🙄 Depression. 

I wanted to ask if anyone else has taken antidepressants which have helped to stop binge eating. I recently started wellbutrin and lybalvi and now consume literally a quarter of the amount of food that I used to. Sometimes I will grab a snack and completely forget about it or even forget to eat all day. This is so different from what my life was before: CONSTANTLY thinking of having food or my next meal. 

I've binged twice since starting about a month and a half ago which isn't bad compared to life before the meds. I feel like an actual human being now that I'm not constantly eating to suppress. Wondering if anyone has been through the same? 

Any input would be great. Good day guys 🤟",curious_les20,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12cwd40/antidepressants_eating_disorder/
A little about my life and seeking for advice on making it better,"Hi. I am 30yo. I am seeking other people's opinions on my case that would help me know myself better and get the proper treatment. Please skip to #3 if you don't want to read about my life.

To give you a better idea about myself- my childhood was pretty stressful, and my parents were fighting a lot with alcohol involved. They both ran businesses and made serious money but did not spend too much time with me when I was a kid, I was with babysitters or other family members most of the time, staying late at school waiting for someone to pick me up. I had anxiety attacks in preschool and cried every time, so I stopped going there. In early school, my anxiety got even worse with panic attacks, nervous twitching, etc. It all got much better when I was 11-12 yo. I made lifetime friendships, which last until today. I had my own life, and my parents did not worry too much about me, although they thought that everything is perfect. Then they got divorced, which brought lots of stress, new people in our house etc. Later on, my parents fell into a huge scam, which made them lose all savings, businesses, and then our house. This time was very stressful, but we somehow managed it, which wasn't easy. It has gotten worse and worse over time with the repo's knocking to our door daily. After finishing college, my mom, with her new husband, migrated to the US. So did my girlfriend. 

Now, moving to my life as an adult, when they all moved to the US, I was the only one living in my foreign country. However, I really enjoyed that time, I had business perspectives and extreme support from childhood friends. In the meantime, I've noticed that my girlfriend is cheating on me, and my mind went somewhere else, I got maniacal thoughts and first signs of depression. All of this resulted in myself leaving everything behind and moving to the US. The first few years were terrible, I overstayed my visa to save my relationship, couldn't work or drive legally, and couldn't go back to my home country since it would be a one way trip. I really felt like in prison for a few years. Every day was very depressive. My childhood anxiety came back along with big social anxiety. I finally got a better job, house, marriage, and citizenship, and depression was coming on and off, but anxiety stayed there. I did not respond or call any of my friends for a few years.

Now, my current life. I lost interest in my marriage, my mood is usually down, I am grumpy and have no energy, and our sex life is none. Last year, I decided to get a treatment and talked to a psychiatrist. He diagnosed me with major depression, general anxiety, and social phobia. I was prescribed 10mg Lexapro. It helped with depression and mood swings, I dont think I've had a single depressive state while taking it. However, it made me emotionally dull, I lost all motivation and thinking about the future, i couldnt truly laugh and didn't care about talking to anyone. It also did not work at all for my social anxiety, it actually made it even worse. I stopped taking it in November when I visited my home country (for the first time after 10 years) for 2 months. The time I've spent there was great, I had no anxiety, depression or phobias at all, I got motivated and outgoing. When I returned to my home in US it all came back. Today I am depressed most of the time, don't want to talk to anyone, isolating myself from family anf friends, I am getting panic attacks when talking to someone at work over the phone (thankfully I'm working from home), I am irritated easily and small things can get me nervous or depressed. I also have extreme fatigue during the day and am feeling sleepy, I sleep 8-9h and have a hard time waking up. I am working out and eating healthy. I also had bloodwork is good, so it must be due to a mental issue.

TLDR:
I had anxiety as a child with lots of stress involved, then it got better until I reached adulthood. A lot of changes and failures caused depression, anxiety and social phobia. I've tried Lexapro which cured my depression but it made me emotionally dull, even more fatigued, reckless, unmotivated, and unsocial. It also escalated my social anxiety, so I stopped taking it after 7 months. I feel tired every day despite sleeping 8h and having a healthy lifestyle, also having a very hard time waking up. I do not have any suicidal thought at all butI have a feeling that my enjoyment of life is over and now it's just existence. My doctor prescribed Trazadone, but I don't really have issues falling asleep, all it takes for me is reading a book for an hour or so. I'm sure what I should do. SSRI's make me even more tired and have an emotional lack. I am not sure if that's a serotonin, dopamine, or norepinephrine issue. I would appreciate it if someone could share their opinion and recommend a medication, supplement, or anything else that would make my life better.
Just to add, I barely ever drink alcohol, no more then once every 2-3 months. But when I drink, I open myself up, I can actually talk to people and have fun, it makes me an extrovert, I dont overdo it only because Im a gym person.

I feel relief when I think of the end,"I'm depressed. But isn't that why we are all here? 

I have MDD, GA, BPD, and PTSD. I'm miserable. I was medicated but stopped when they stopped working as well as they used to and just started giving me sever night sweats and AWFUL migraines. Years ago I was held in the hospital for 4 days on psych hold. I was then placed in a behavioral treatment center for two months. I work for myself and by myself, So that meant that not only did I rack up over $10,000 in debt from the hospital and the treatment center... But I also lost two months of revenue. Awesome. 

I had been seeing my personal therapist for a couple of years prior to this and then 3 years after. I have not seen her in a while because I was doing better. I have severely spiraled again and honestly I'm at the point where I just want to end it.

Despite the months and months of couples therapy, my marriage has gone to down hill. My husband won't sleep with me, never takes me out, doesn't spend time with me, blames me for everything bc I'm the one with the disorders etc. My best friend ghosted me after she got a divorce because apparently everyone that was friends with her husband was a trigger for her. I lost my salon front and had the building condemned bc the owner wouldn't take care of it (around $80k in repairs and remediation). I work from home and make less then usual, but... Enough. My husband won't get on board with finches and I pay 3x more in bills then he does and have to beg him for help while he does nothing but play videogames. 

I feel unwanted, unloved and defeated. The more I think of ending it... The easier it seems and I am finally feeling some sort of peace when I think of it. Every day I'm less worried about how it will impact my family. I just want it to be over. Idk why I keep trying here and there when I know it's absolutely pointless.

I’m two different people…,"Buckle up…
I don’t like talking about myself, I don’t like talking to myself, I don’t really like myself. 
I’m turning 20 this year, I’d like to say I’m proud I’ve made it this far but I’m not.
I’ve done things that most people haven’t at a young age I’ve travelled all over the world by myself. I’ve lived in Costa Rica for months on my own because I felt like it, I have a stable job, a good body and have been with and loved many people, I have great friends who I can truly talk to. So why do I feel this way you may ask? Well I don’t really have an answer. I’ve had multiple councilors and therapists and it always comes back to some arbitrary jumble of words like “stop presenting yourself as someone else” “be yourself” “stop hiding your emotions”. I’ve tried it, when I’m truly myself I depress others which makes me feel more depressed in return, because I fear making anyone else feel even a sliver of what i do in my head - as I know how torturously sad it is and would never wish it in anyone else.
When I’m my false self I depress myself more because I know that I’m hiding what I truly am. It seems that no matter who I am or who I pretend to be I hurt myself in a repetitive onslaught of circular emotions and feelings that seem to Cling to my mind like magnets to iron. All I want is to find the me that can be at peace or god forbid maybe even happy. But that seems like a pipe dream to were I am in each painful moment of my existence. I don’t want answers, I don’t want help and I despise pity. I just find myself questioning ,more often than not, why do I exist when I’m sure the infinite amount of possible versions of me would do a hell of a better job at simply being in this world.

"I can't do this anymore, everything is black","I've always struggled with insecurities (mostly related to sex, size, apperance) and depression, since I was a child. I have social anxiety and have always feared to not be enough, and I overcompensated this by trying to be the center of attention; this resulted in having discrete success in relationships and social life in general, yet never really enjoyed it, especially relationships with girls because I've always feared to be abandoned, and usually this caused it to become true, like, almost always.

All like this until last year, when I discovered I have MS. Since then my life started getting worse, everyday.
This illness haven't caused me any disability (yet), only minor synthoms like less vision in one eye, that has improved a lot since when it first appeared, tremors and some muscle rigidity; the problem is that from the psychological point of view, this shit is hell. It's scary, I'm 25, still young, and this shit came out of nowhere. Like depression wasn't enough.
Then, some months ago my 2years girlfriend left me, and this caused me one of the hardest pains I've ever felt, I loved her like no one else before and now I feel empty, life looks colorless, I can't think of myself with a bright future, I see myself alone with this illness, no one there to love me, no relationship, no marriage, no kids, no more fun, no projects, no nothing. I just see my life going down the drain, and feel sad because I have lived my 25 years with insecurities, fear of being judged, excluded.

Today I've had a big fight with my best friend, and I feel that I've lost him too. All because I couldn't stand a comment he made about something I did, even if I was in the right, I couldn't stand him not understanding the issue, because I felt attacked, I always feel attacked, vulnerable.

I can't do this shit anymore, I feel weak, and I don't see this situation getting better, at all.

Seeking advice about Effexor,"My psych doc recently prescribed me  Effexor for depression and anxiety, as well as adhd. I am very hesitant to try it because I have heard it can have problematic side effects and is very hard to get off of. Im mainly worried about insomnia, feeling tired during the day and mental sluggishness.

For additional context, I take 36mg concerta as well.

I have tried zoloft, lexapro and prozac before with decent results but eventually I developed mental foggyness and persistant feeling of fatigue/tiredness, and then insomnia which made the previous symptoms.

I am also wary of it helping with adhd and interacting with 36mg concerta I currently take.

TL;DR: my questions are?

How bad are the side effects?
Does it cause insonmia?
Does it cause daytime tiredness?
Does it help at all with ADHD and difficulty to concentrate?",jmus9,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12d3mq6/seeking_advice_about_effexor/

Trying to make your life better only invites further pain,When you give up and don't interact with people and barely leave your bed you grow numb to things. When you do finally try to make your life better and be social or work hard the only thing you are rewarded with is failure and suffering. I finally started to be friendly and go out and do everything I'm supposed to and I've fucking destroyed any sort of hope I have. I am so miserable and broken and cannot help but put all my hopes into absolute bullshit and then just be worse when I fail. I cant talk to my only friend because of my pathetic jealousy and worthlessness and I swear I'll end up taking all of these thoughts to my grave as soon as that comes.,ThrowawayBlueJay97,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12d3jsu/trying_to_make_your_life_better_only_invites/

everything is going downhill,"my grandpa will die soon, he has a pretty advanced cancer according to what the doctors say but they haven't even found where the cancer is, everything is so confusing, he might have a type of cancer called CUP which is rare because cells are found in the body but the place the cancer began is not known

and he's just getting worse and worse everyday, he can't move, he can barely eat, he can do nothing but feeling pain. he can't even start chemo treatment because he's so weak right now that couldn't even take the first session...

he wasn't the best person, im aware of it but i cant just avoid feeling bad for him because i don't want him to suffer this much, this whole situation makes me feel completely useless, frustrated and stressed (im also starting to lose my hair). On the other side my grandma is also sick and can barely walk because she's got a calcaneal spur and no one can help her because we're focused on helping my grandpa feel less pain, nights have been a nightmare for the whole fam. I bought grandma some shoes but I know it isn't enough, she needs to be treated because she will for sure get worse soon

i feel bad, useless because i can't do anything else for my family, i am not in a good economic situation to help them the way i want

and all i can do is cry and feel bad about myself, i always feel like life is always gonna be this hard and to be honest i don't want to live anymore. Living is stressful, every situation in my life is filled with problems, being an adult is hard and i can't take any more responsibilities. i want to see grandpa more often but i have no time, i want to see my grandma but i have not enough time, i want to tell my family that im trans and im not brave enough, i feel like im gonna be trapped in this cage forever, i want to do the things i like but i have no time, i dont even have enough time to be with my girlfriend and we live in the same house, she also have things to do (she's a teacher) and we have to take care of our own stuff.

"I've come to so many realizations on the past few months, and I feel depressed over it.","a few months ago, (late December) I made a post in r/offmychest describing how I've been feeling depressed since I was 11, and I didn't know why. since then, I think I know the exact reasons, I just don't know how to solve them. one major reason is my mom. I have severe trauma block, my earliest memory was just 4 years ago, (I'm 14) and since around mid February alot of memories have been coming back and I've come to the realization that I have been mentally abused, and neglected by both my parents. I still remember the day my father left me, and tried to manipulate me into leaving my mom to live with him, and my mom gave me severe abandonment issues, making me feel depressed any time someone stops talking to me, and I'm very clingy. another reason is being alone, ever since 6th grade.(age 11) I've never had more than 2 friends, ever. and I've only had 1 friend that I feel like I could genuinely trust, but we moved after only knowing him for a year.
when I close the door after coming home, I just feel so incredibly alone, it hurts. with both of these combined, I feel as if I don't have a real personality and can't relate to myself.

It’s been too long. I’m exhausted,"I can’t remember ever NOT being depressed. I truly can’t. Even as a small child. Everything seems dark and laborious. Nothing seems hopeful. I don’t know what to do anymore. I started getting better with school only to start failing again this semester after so much hard work before this. I can’t get out of bed. I’m sick constantly. I’m in chronic physical pain and have multiple disabilities and come from a broken, abusive home and poverty. I keep losing the few people in my biological family who felt like actual chosen parents and decent people to cancer and heart problems and other illnesses. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t see an end to the emotional and physical pain that I’m in. I don’t see my life being successful or happy or long despite me being in a beautiful and wonderful romantic relationship with someone I love. I know he is someone I am grateful for. I love him dearly. But I feel like a burden on him. I can’t shake the feeling that I’ll never be okay or good enough, that one day he’ll figure out how rotten I am and how many bad choices I make and how depressed I am and will call it quits. I hurt so badly that I go numb. I can’t sleep. When I do, I oversleep, and I have flashbacks to traumatic moments or other nightmares. I just don’t know what to do. I’ve tried everything I can. I’ve done therapy for years and medications and all of that. I only seem to have temporary moments of relief. They never last long enough. I feel like a constant disappointment and a constant failure. My physical appearance makes me feel disgusting, and I’ve been abused and bullied about it all my life both at home and in school. I’m scared to leave my room after the sexual assaults on my campus as I’m a sexual abuse survivor. I’m constantly scared that I’ll be physically or sexually or emotionally harmed again as it’s happened so many times. I feel no optimism or motivation. I just feel like I weight a thousand pounds and every movement is labored thusly. Ever since my grandpa died I’ve felt like I died too. He was the closest person to me in my biological family. He was my kind gravity, my constant. The world felt at least sometimes better knowing he was in it. He was a father to me. A best friend. A mentor. He was a stable and normal and loving influence in a crazy abusive family and he cared for and provided for me when no one else would. No I feel lost and dead and hopeless. 3 years have passed and my chronic pain and this grief have only worsened. I can’t even think about him anymore. My mind has put him in some kind of dark corner. I can’t remember his voice anymore even. I feel perpetually alone and misunderstood, always doing the wrong thing or saying the wrong thing, incapable of change, destined to be as horrible and miserable as my biological parents. I’ve stopped wanting. It’s like I don’t know how to anymore. I’ve failed too many times and been hurt too much. I’m in my twenties yet I feel 90 years old. Making art, listening to music, putting on makeup… nothing feels satisfying anymore. Even things that used to.

Therapy in my country is awful and meds aren't enough.," I live in the UK and our mental health services are trash, CBT which is meant to be a slow process is done over time, but the NHS does 6 to 8 sessions of 30 mins a session, I've got no friends (partly by choice because my mental health was just hurting those around me), and I have little to no life experience, so I'm lost and confused about how to keep going.

I want to find a hobby or something fun to pass the time, but because of my physical disabilities I can't engage in the things I have interest in, such as music or martial arts/sports, I'd like to enjoy gaming, but I find playing games of any genre to be boring or frustrating.

It feels like my life is over at 27 because my physical health can't be treated as it's baked into my genetics, and my mental health is in the trash because the only things that brought me joy have been locked off by my physical health, it's a cycle.

Another day, I’m left to question how Im so far behind 
Its still not ok. 
Alone
ANXIETY
Hate
Some days it gets so hard, but I don’t want to slip away. 
I am to blame
Better off without me
Scars and stitches, I’m to blame
Where are my dreams?
I alone will find my way
I’m still alive but It’s not enough to take my pain away
I tried to walk a line but it’s more than I can take
I think I’m breaking down
I’ve been going out of my head again, waiting for a life line 
Don’t wait, make it. But how?
It all goes by so fast
It seems like I’m waisting time? Am I doing alright?
I want it all back but
I can’t take back what I’ve become
I’ve gotta find a better way
I declare war, on me
Got a feeling I don’t belong
I’ve had enough of going out of my head
The voices in my head are getting too loud
I can’t take it anymore 
It’s about time for living,
Surely I’ve paid the devil his bill?
I wanna find a place where I belong,
But it’s fading to the stars
I am a victim of my own self worth
Don’t try for perfect, it’s never enough
I wish I could breathe, the weight on my back feels like a ton
I could be so much more than this 
We’re all a lot more alone in this world than we realize 

Depression takes over, suddenly, all the days blend together to create one suffocating, unending loop. So I try remember the things that made me happy, but my brain starts to erase every memory that ever bought me joy, and eventually all I can think about is how life has always been this way... and will always be this way. It doesn’t get easier, it never will.

The relationship was not good and it wasn't one I could kesve or my life would of been f***Ed sooner, after she got comfortable the abuse and r@pe started, she would pull knicee to me and eventually it got too much and I just left(I could never go to my mum bc she would of blamed me and aas also homophobic) but then all that started it never stopped ans I left she had told me if I told anyone then she would fk shi up for me so I kept quiet but then she went and she done it anw so I had to leave the school, it has been non stop harassment and my school is about 20 miles away from my old one, she has got people to beat me up in school and aplsorts, I have no friends apart from 1 person who had tried to ohs last night and I feel like he ant gna stick around in this world, im done I didn't see myself being here this long and I got no plans or when I leave school in a few weeks before exams.

I know who i am but not how i am.,"Recently i came back to a state i had left in a different way.  
I've been careless, clueless, cold and just easy going with my life. Few things had changed which brought me great pain where my mind started to realize things i havent thought before.  


I noticed i know who i am but not how i am. It feels like i exist without a reason. I dont have hobbies, or things i really like that could keep me distracted for days. I like multiple things like movies and music but its not something so great so motivating or anything of that sort.  


Every day i wake up feeling tired without exception go to work do what i have to go back home just to exist. Around people i sometimes tend to smile, talk, look like i enjoy things while i dont know if i am.  
I guess im just making time move with them without thinking much of anything.  


I cant really know what love is, i cant tell what happiness is or any of that sort.   
Dont get me wrong i laugh i smile but i do it automatically even when i feel no happiness. I can't seem to understand myself or know who i am.  
I lie, i trick people, i talk to them, i smile, i make friends, i go out, even use some people but without a clear goal. Not to hurt them or gain anything, I do all that because its a situation that is presented me with a opportunity...opportunity that is not defined by any gains.  


I kind of noticed that since i was 16 my morals and my feelings were missing. I dated 2 girls but first one didnt bring me love or happiness she was there more as a part of social or human life, the second felt different and when i finished things with her it destroyed me until i started thinking if during that time i liked her or i liked her presence. I realized that maybe i never liked her for who she was and just liked how she was. It wasnt HER i wanted it was someone like her not because i liked her as a person i liked her as something that changes my day to day life.  


Recently i feel like my lack of emotion or understanding of emotion is making me irritated and distant. I stopped caring about people, stopped waiting for them, i sleep way earlier, i talk way less and feel down way more while trying to know who i am and what i feel.  


I feel sadness but its not sadness where i want to cry its sad emptiness where i ""want"" to cry to know what it is. I want to make myself sad to a point i know im sad and i dont just sit feeling horrible for a reason i cant explain, I feel like i want to disappear but maybe i want to be found. Im not sure who i am or what kind of person i am myself. I can only describe certain things by the way people react about me.

I'm only still here because I don't want my mum to be upset. She's the only person who actually cares about me. My so-called friends don't talk or hang out with me, and have been avoiding any hangouts I arrange to the point where I've stopped bothering. There's one mate, he's a bro, we finished watching Star Trek Deep Space Nine together in person tonight, which was nice. But even if I disappeared tomorrow, he'd be fine, all our other mates play games and hang out with him, so he won't miss me for long.

I'm sick of being alone. There's this girl I like, I've had a crush on her for years, it's honestly sad at this point. Recently found out she has a boyfriend, good for her, I'm genuinely happy for her, they seem like a good pair for each other. But it still hurt a lot to find it out, why? It's not like I made an effort to make my feelings known, on the contrary, I was far too afraid of rejection and ruining what little friendship I had with her. But now we barely talk, she's in a happy relationship, and I'm sad and alone. Pretty pathetic huh.

Dunno why I'm even writing any of this down. None of it matters. It doesn't matter to any of you internet strangers reading this, and it won't matter when I'm gone because nobody I know in real life knows about this account.

Oh well, maybe I'll finally man up and go give a tree a nice high speed hug someday. Or maybe I'll keep being a pathetic coward and existing as I am.",inanimate_coward,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12ctocq/why_should_i_continue_on/

Any alternatives other than working out for intense/frequent episodes?,"Hi everyone,

This is my first time posting here so I’m sorry about the rambling. I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety since I was a teen and one of the outlets to help me was working out. I’ve been diagnosed with MDD (major depressive disorder), ADHD, OCD, and anxiety, I’ve been okay with handling it until recently. Earlier this year I tore a back muscle which put some strain on my SI joints. I recovered but last month I aggravated my SI joints again and I’ve been trying to heal from it. It’s been a month and no improvement. I can’t do any activities. I cannot stand, sit or walk for long periods or some days at all. If I walk it’s a snails pace and I have to stop frequently. I’m having a hard time handling it, I know it’ll get better but not being able to workout has been making me more depressed and the episodes are much more frequent. Im taking my meds, meeting my therapist, physiotherapist and following up with my doctor. I’m just stuck and sad for days at a time…especially when I cannot even go to the gym to do my stretches or walk. So I guess, are there any recommendations that I can borrow? I’m not a great swimmer (taking lessons) and my physiotherapist said to only do it for 10mins. I’m an avid reader and I’ve been doing that, watching shows here and there but it doesn’t feel enough. I used to run, row, walk when I got sad but now it’s not doable. I’m sad so I eat, and get depressed and stop eating and then cry cause I’m gaining weight and it’s a whole cycle lol. I’m sorry for pouring it all here but it’s hard to explain to everyone at home. They’re saying to let it heal and it’s just the gym. But I cannot get out of the loophole. 


TL;DR : aggravated my SI joints and cannot workout. Lack of workout making me have more depressive episodes. Any alternatives that you could recommend?",Ill_Dirt_234,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12czsi2/any_alternatives_other_than_working_out_for/

Obligated to write something,"I had a breakdown in September 2021, where I was diagnosed with severe depression. I was prescribed antidepressants, the first set were no good and made me paranoid and I felt like bugs were crawling over me. 

I now take Sertraline which helps but it’s a low dose of 50mg, at first these seemed to work but I’ve had suicidal ideations and depressive episodes. In the first few weeks, I felt quite happy and productive but as time has gone on, the depression always creeps back in. Sometimes for a few days, sometimes for a week or longer. I really struggle to get out of bed and just want to curl up into a ball and not go to work. I mentioned this to the GP but they think the dosage is right. I gave up with my CBT as I think it is a waste of time.

I have always struggled to hold down jobs as I get overwhelmed by it and the stress of having more and more put on. I would love to be able to work full time and put this behind me but sooner or later, I have a breakdown. Thankfully, I have never been hospitalised but this time I think I need it.

"""Snapped"" at a customer and lost my composure at work","   Yesterday I was working our morning shift and that means I take public phone calls from people calling the business for questions/coordination. Right after getting off my 10-min break I fielded a call from someone asking about our ""no cell phones in-store"" policy and it just set something off in me where it felt like I was getting jerked around or like she just had a bone to pick. I just got impatient all of a sudden when she said ""other stores don't do that..."" and I responded with ""well, feel free to shop at other store, and not ours"" and then she said I was rude. I just didn't say anything because I knew I fucked up and just got hit with a wave of anxiety, and kind of just went non-responsive. She asked for our manager by name, I passed it off to them and about 5 minutes later came back (and was super chill about it) just saying that when it comes to explaining store policies, you can let a manager do that from the get-go and just pass the call on. Mgr didn't hold anything against me and probably forgot all about it, but about an hour before my shift was ending I couldn't hold back the tears, and just barely managed to keep a smile on my face as I greeted customers entering the store. One of my co-workers noticed and asked if I needed to go to the back for a minute and compose myself, and I wish I'd taken them up on their offer, because I just choked the tears back down and kept at it. I just knew that if I did, I wouldn't really be composing myself, I'd be rapidly decomposing myself, basically, haha...

   I just haven't had a chance to just let it out regarding how stressed I've felt lately, and how everything -outside- of work is just paralyzing me with fear. I am trying to find a place to live in a city with a pretty major housing shortage, and my part time hours don't net me enough income on my own to rent my own place. And I just don't know how the fuck I'm going to be able to collaborate with anyone on getting a place effectively when I go days without replying to people's texts. 

After my shift was over I looked my co-worker in the eyes and said ""Thank you so much. Thank you."" and pretty much right after leaving I had to keep choking back sobbing. It's like my body just won't let me cry.

17 M help with depression,"hey guys i want to know if i have deppression or not. i have these sympthoms:
 1 feeling hopeless and empty.
 2 I feel worthless all the time for eg. when someone tells me ""you are smart"" it makes my day or even week when normal people just dont care about it i dont value myself so when people greet me with something i feel happy but that happens rarely sometimes i dont care about that greets  and i just go whatever i also find it hard to get motivated and i always blame myself i cant remember the last time i greeted myself or not blame myself for a thing. 
3 feeling depressive or sad. When there is something that can distract me like family friends or video games i dont feel sad i laugh with my friends but when these distractions are not there i suddenly feel sad again. And its just some small things maybe im too sensitive? But i cant change it i will give an example when i see a kid i dont care about the good side i always go like that kid will be sad 
and figure out how cruel world is. But thats not like that i know it but i cant change im tired of this pessimist feeling whenever i see happy people.
 4 trouble concentrating or remembering things. I always forget things i read on a book i like to research and read stuff but i just cant keep it in my mind and i mean like %90 of the text
5 Tiredness and lack of energy. I was always a lazy person but i feel like i really lack energy for a long time i always stretch or yawn even though i dont move. I dont want to go out to meet with my friends i sometimes lie to not meet with them even though i like them. I dont want to talk people cause i dont trust my social skills or think that they dont value me they listening me just to listen they dont care about my words.
 I have social anxiety and it makes my life hell its like a force stopping me from doing certain actions even though its all in my mind 
I might not have depression due to lack of self awareness actually i dont even know if i lack self awareness or not cause i always think im inferior than other people.
I dont get pleasure from things i mostly stay silent in conversations cause i sometimes find it pointless (not because we're all gonna die) like gossipping and it really hurts connections between friends or just dont improve at all and humans are social individuals thats what made us survive strong social connections.
I cant really remember when it all started cause i wasnt aware of it.( I would say about 1 year ago but not precisely)
Im also a very sensitive person so my mood can easily change 
I also dont have conversations with my parents If i have depression i dont know how to tell my parents about it cause im sure they think im not sad 
And i dont think i can make those sentences while talking to a psychiatrist maybe its just a teen thing that will pass?
So if i have depression should i go to a psychiatrist or a psychologist? i dont really want therapy i know what to do but i just cant make it (im not very knowledgable on therapy please dont get me wrong)

At this point I would've sh but even that isn't giving me a sense of relief.

My Life,"Hey, actually today was a great day finally had real fun again. But when I just came home my depression caught up with me again. I just lay on the floor for several minutes and cried. I come from germany so sorry for my english. I just had to share this with someone because I hope that I'm not the only one who feels like this, because I have the feeling that if this goes on much longer that I will not manage and endure for long.

just venting,"ok i’m gonna vent because why not. 

i hate telling people my problems because i feel like i’m a burden. there’s only so much they can do. i can only imagine how mentally exhausting it must be to hear your friend/daughter complain about the same problems over and over again.  

there are people in my life who simply do not understand why i am “depressed all the time” when i have everything i need to be happy: family, friends, food, nice house, wealth, etc. 

it feels as though my feelings are invalid. it feels as though i have no right feeling this way. it feels like i’m being ungrateful and inconsiderate. it feels like i am the problem. 

that’s when i begin to wallow in self-pity. 

well unlike you, i have always had to deal with attention issues (possibly adhd), memory problems, anxiety (it’s getting worse as i get older), attachment issues (also getting worse with time), feeling excluded from everyone. i have to deal with all of this at once. it is absolutely mentally exhausting. yesterday i was home all day and the pain was unbearable. i could feel it physically. i was breathing more heavily, my chest felt tight, heart felt heavy. i began to think about all of the times i have been excluded in my life. all of the friendships i’ve had, and they never lasted. the pain is still stuck with me in the very depths of my heart. i could feel it all resurfacing last night. i’ve cried so much in the past, i didn’t have any more tears to let out. 

i never want to feel that way ever again. i wish there was an immediate cure. i feel like i can’t deal with it any longer. 

i went to my second therapy session this morning. i didn’t find it useful at all. it just feels like an interrogation every time we meet. after she finishes asking me questions (in the last two sessions),  she tells me her observations (stuff i already know like a constant fear of losing people, feeling excluded and lonely) then provides me with some external help (to help with my anxiety since we are focusing on that right now) like worksheets, coping skills or meditation videos. i already know everything she tells me. i guess talking to her about past experiences have helped me see the root of some of it with a bit more clarity, but it’s stuff i already know. 

i don’t know. i feel lost. my head really hurts. the worst part of it all is that everyday is just a loop. so i have to experience these feelings every single day, maybe less on days when something exciting is happening, i guess i tend to suppress those feelings on those days. 

i joined a co-ed fraternity a few months ago and it put me in a better place mentally (did not completely remove those feelings but i did feel relatively better?) i remember still experiencing depression. i had everything i wanted, why was i feel this way? why do i not feel secure? i remember messing up (due to my depression and lack of self esteem) and getting kicked out of the fraternity. it affected me so bad. i feel lost and alone now.  i don’t have many friends and no actual friend group. 

these thoughts crossed my mind last night. this is why i don’t like staying home because i am left alone with these unbearable thoughts. it’s so frustrating. my therapist told me to journal, which is basically what i’m doing right now and i can confidentially say that it is helping me see and understand my thoughts a bit better. still though, i am suffering on the inside. the breaking point for me last night was seeing others have a good time in their own little groups and feeling left out. i don’t even like telling anyone this because it’s so embarrassing and weird. like i feel like i’m acting like a child. other people experience this too but don’t constantly complain about it and make it such a big deal. 

sigh. 

in moments like these, i often think about how we are all going to die some day, and it puts me at ease. none of this will matter. everything i am experiencing is short term. but still the pain feels unbearable sometimes. 

i tried looking for a man in hopes to combat loneliness but i immediately stopped myself. i’m no where near ready. whoever tells me otherwise just doesn’t get it. i don’t think they will ever get it. no one knows me. that’s such a scary thought. people say i’m ready but how can i be if i literally have attachment issues? it doesn’t make any sense. how can a person with unhealed wounds get into a relationship and expect it to help them. i am not going to dump my problems on another person and expect them to help me through it. that is absolutely selfish. why do they have to suffer just so i’ll feel less lonely and more secure? i am not getting into a relationship until i help myself. by the way, i’m not saying don’t reach out for help from a significant other. i’m saying seeking a relationship with the sole purpose of fulfilling your wants and needs (dumping all of ur trauma on another person and expecting them to help you change) is very selfish and unhealthy in my opinion.  

ok i’m going to stop typing because my phone is glitching. that’s pretty much all i had to say.",malthegreat8,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12cwqka/just_venting/
Not sure where to post this,"Can anyone relate to this? Or share about their experience. This is kind of a vent but I was hoping I'm not alone in my feelings at least.

I've been really fucked up lately like downing a bunch of kratom extracts and promethazine and a bunch of vodka and I'm coming down from the past week. I dropped the ball bad. I was doing good. Taking care of my health at least. I was calorie tracking and lifting.

Since last week i totally 180d. Binge drinking binge eating fucking disgusting. And I feel so bad. 

Everytime I see this girl that I'm cool with I feel so bad knowing that like she's actually pretty attractive and I'm really not. It's like it hurts knowing that there's no reciprocation of interest like I highly doubt she or most would be sexually attracted to anything about me or anything I do.

Anyways not so much to do about her but I feel like shit because I am not sexy and people don't look at me in that light and I feel so unwanted and undesirable and just... Gross.

I'm so fixated on these insecurities and it takes me out of my priorities like school. I'm doing so badly this semester. I feel like I'm fucked and just want this to all stop. I want to feel pleasure. I feel deadened by the Lexapro. Muted now. But it helps the panick attacks.

Missing an old friend hurts like hell,"I had an old online friend that I cut off 7 months ago. we were really close, we would talk daily for hours and promised to meet irl someday. we told each other how much we loved and appreciated the other. she was one of my best friends. our friendship was usually amazing, we would fight more than we did with other friends but it wasnt anything too bad. 

she started becoming impatient with me towards the end. we would get into a lot more fights. she would still talk to me and start conversations with me but her responses were a lot colder, i dont know how to explain this. After a month I decided to cut her off, I asked to speak to her and I told her why I was cutting her off and we had a conversation about it, we ended on good terms.

I asked her if she disliked me and she basically said she never disliked me and liked me as a person/wants what's best for me but i was overly sensitive and made things about myself. We said goodbye to each other and that was that.

However, not a day goes by that I don't think about her. I fantasize about us being friends again, i was jealous of our other online friend because they would get in calls and play games together. i was jealous and obsessive looking back, and everything she said was true. 

I had blamed her for everything, but I'm only starting to realize I was to blame as well. We both became toxic to each other. why the hell did i cut her off, why didnt i ask her what was wrong first, why didnt i try to fix it im such an idiot. why couldnt we just communicate with the other. my friends who knew her said not to go back to her and they think shes toxic but im realizing i was also toxic.

it makes me feel sick, i wish we could just be friends again. i want her to know im sorry, i regret so much and its killing me inside.",Infinite_Ladder_4315,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12cwhaj/missing_an_old_friend_hurts_like_hell/
Think my mental state is getting worse.,"Currently a college student in my third year of undergrad. I started experiencing depression when I was roughly 16 (2017) when my Father’s cancer started getting really bad and I obtained a better sense of reality and how truly bad of a disease it truly is. I had to witness one of the most important individuals in my life slowly deteriorate in front of my eyes. Coming home from high school everyday to see him laying on our couch in pain in combination with the strong painkillers made it a hard sight to say at the very least. He unfortunately lost his battle in 2019 and passed away during my last semester of Junior year in high school. During his last 1+ week I ended up getting kicked out of my high school and was sent to a secondary school because I had a THC pen in my possession so not only did I lose my father I lost all my friends and was tossed into a school with kids who behaved poorly to say the least. I hate to sound super defensive but I didn’t feel as if I belonged there and was even told so by the counselors and principle of the school. I used the marijuana as a coping mechanism to somewhat numb my emotions and calm me down from my home environment. I admit it was stupid for me to bring that into a school environment but I was so deep into derealization and depression I didn’t feel as if life was real anymore so I just didn’t have the mental capacity to care. Never knew if my father knew I just got sent to a secondary school a few days prior to him passing away but after that my mental state continued to deteriorate and got VERY VERY severely worse. Would end up going to my secondary school and bawling my eyes out mid class while attempting to just keep to myself because these kids were ruthless here and wannabe gangsters who thought they had to act hard and tough around other kids. I didn’t want anymore harassment or bullying because of my emotions on top of the shit I was already dealing with. Ended up being let back into my home school district in January of 2020 which lasted less than a solid 2 months before all schools closed down for COVID-19. Was thankful I got to see all of my friends again and went onto college after graduation in June. Started at a 2-year community college before I planned on transferring into a University to receive my bachelor’s degree. The two years I spent in CC didn’t feel all that bad I thought things were getting better. Was coping with drugs still since classes were virtual for a solid 1.5 years so smoking weed after my class helped with my situation and I could finally relax and do my school work which I genuinely enjoyed and was interested in. My drug use consisted of marijuana, adderall, Xanax, Oxycodone, Morphine, LSD, and Shrooms. The Oxy and Morphine, and Marijuana was used daily while the other shit was every once in a while. Quit the painkillers and adderall my sophomore year of college, continued with just weed and the occasional LSD or shroom usage. Received my associate’s degree in May 2022. Got admitted to a prestigious University on the highest scholarship they provide and been attending there since Fall of 2022. Felt good the first month at my new school and strived to do well and keep up my GPA (3.63). Ended up deciding to kick all drugs except the adderall which helped me focus and stay on task. Shitty thing is my depression has slowly been creeping back into my life from September-April (now). I’m feeling so unmotivated, tired constantly even with a good nights rests and shit even the adderall which is literally amphetamines combined with a Red Bull can’t keep me awake. I feel like I’m mentally jumping back into 2019 with the way I feel and everything is coming to the surface again from what I never addressed from an emotional standpoint as I always numbed myself with drugs. Now that I’m essentially sober and only using adderall which is indeed prescribed everything is coming back and I’m feeling terrible everyday. Started noticing I’m isolating myself from everyone, not talking much, excessive anxiety when talking to people, inability to learn new concepts, etc. Not sure what to do at this point. I learned so much being a Psychology major on a Pre-Med track and can appear to help everyone but myself. Can always give my friends good advice which typically works out but when it comes to myself I can’t do anything to fix me. Just hoping May will come sooner so I can finish up this semester and attempt to work on myself more and fix what’s broken. Being lonely and having nobody to turn to sucks but it’s taught me a lot at the same time. Sorry if this is more of a venting post but this is appearing long enough and that’s not even half my story up to this point in my life. If you read this far really thank you and hearing me out. Proud of what I was able to achieve up to this point but I feel like I’m slipping away and my future goals are slowly fading with my current state. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Best of luck to everyone in a similar position we’re all strong individuals that are held back by chemical imbalances and unforeseen circumstances that slow us down and force us to overcome. I like to think there’s always light at the end of the tunnel it just sometimes takes a while to see that as some tunnels are further than others.

Cruelty of People,"2021 was a year that I discovered myself; I discovered what power I had and I thrived in a dark world however it wasn’t long until my fun bright free spirited demeanor caught the attention of every single evil soul in San Francisco being used for image appearances and being seen as a fantasy rather than a human. I went from being a country guy to living it big being a hot shot new adult working with cutting edge technology. My beauty and intelligence caught the attention of every single person and because of that I lost who I was. I was raped, assaulted, abducted by an Uber, drugged by my roommate, outcasted by peers, and a year later I went from being a research and developer working in a laboratory to being fired for taking time off for my appointments. I was called unreliable during a time of need.

TW: brief mention of suicide and self harm 


Hey everyone, 

It’s my first time posting here so I apologize if my formatting is wrong. I’m just gonna jump right into it. I’m 28F. 

Throughout my life I’ve had some really low periods. During these it’s hard to get out of bed and everything feels like life or death. I don’t feel like I’m capable of doing anything, my self esteem plummets, and I just get this feeling in the pit of my stomach. I get terrified to go to sleep, hate waking up, all that fun stuff. 

I am diagnosed with anxiety and take SSRI’s for it. This feeling stays with me, but it’s very well managed through coping skills and meds, IMO. 

However, when this low feeling hits, I’m just at a loss. I’m terrified of it. I usually do whatever I can to make some big changes to alleviate it. I’ll quit jobs on the spot with nothing lined up because going to work makes me feel like I’m going to die. I’ll move cities, start a new venture, anything to make it go away. I have had one suicide attemp due to this feeling, but I am NOT suicidal right now. Self harm has been on my mind, but I’m okay in that regard. 

Recently, my mom passed away. We had a very complex relationship and her death has left me very not okay. I also have two teenage siblings who I’m worried about. They’re under the care of a guardian, though we’re very close. Their dad, who’s not had any rights to them, is in court with their guardian and I’m involved, along with my involvement as the executor of the estate. 

My life right now is good. I have a great, stable career that I love, a wonderful and supportive fiancé, and an absolutely perfect step child. We’re moving next month and up until a few days ago I was hurt and confused by my moms death but I was healthy and overall okay and even happy. 

With everything going on, it makes sense id be feeling low. But that feeling is creeping up and I’m absolutely terrified. I took 2 days off work because the thought of going in makes me feel like I’m going to die. I’m conquering and going in today and I want to vomit everywhere. I suddenly don’t know what I’m doing, I feel completely incapable and if it makes any sense I feel like there’s this big black hole following me around threatening to suck me in any moment. 

I’m trying so hard to stay put. Sit with my feelings. Rationalize. Take everything moment by moment. I have some time off coming up, I’m painting our new place, I’m planning fun dates with my step kid, but nothing is helping. I’m on the verge of tears all the time. I knew I was slipping but I was still okay and now I feel like I’m gone. It never lasts a few days. 

I have a counselor set up a for my days off but I’ve had such little success with counselor and with my state of mind I’m worried I’ll just self sabotage and not put in the work. And I’m just exhausted. I’m so so so tired. 

I don’t know what exactly I’m looking for. I don’t know what to tell my fiancé when he asks what he can do. I’m just hoping for advice I guess on how to get through this, someone to tell me it won’t last, or someone to tell me it will and how to get through. I want the life I’ve built.

Sudden realisation,"So I’ve had slight depression for many years. Started at uni where I was diagnosed with the big theee - Anxiety, Depression and Stress. Not surprising considering I had had depression for about 5 years already and then university added to it. Was dealing with it quite well until a realisation today. 
Family were visiting and they were asking each other, in a very joking manner, for some light hearted fun, who would each other call if they had to bury a body? As I mentioned it was very light hearted and a fun game to imagine each other phoning people and see which of their friends would step up and why. We couldn’t call family, had to be a non-family member. And I realised there was no one I could call. I have a couple of friends but they don’t like speaking on the phone and we only text. Apart from them there is no one I talk to. Everyone else was like ‘John or Eddie or this that or the other’. But I kept quiet and managed to stay out of it.

I am cursed and I hate myself. I hate life.,"I have never been happy. I’m honestly very bitter and jealous of people with average/good looks and a vivid personality and smart brain. There’s not a single good thing about me. I’m not over exaggerating. I do NOT have body dysmorphia. Every part of my body/personality is “off” and not “easy on the eyes”. I have been told numerous times that I am the ugliest girl someone has ever seen. Also a robot. And the worst part is, I’ve always thought that too but before people said anything I thought maybe I’m too hard on myself. But nope. It’s the hard cold fact. I am extremely EXTREMELY ugly. I have a goose neck, a buffalo hump, I am overweight with no butt or shape, a large back, wide shoulders, saggy boobs, can’t lose weight I have tried everything, tiny dull eyes, tiny lips, no jawline, a BIG head, a large forehead, big pointy nose, I look like a man, zero energy or enthusiasm and don’t even get me started on my personality…it’s also the worst. I can’t explain it. It’s just so so so dull and empty. I feel SO FUCKING guilty 24/7 because I can’t feel empathy. I have never been able to have an intelligent conversation or ideas/thoughts. I can’t participate in conversations about anything. It’s just all about existential dread and gloom and self hate. If I’m not thinking those things or having anxious thoughts it’s just blank. I believe I have a very low iq. I was always the one in class to not understand anything. Because of my looks/personality/low intelligence I have only had 3 friends in my life but have had zero friends for 12 years now and I’m 26. On top of everything, I have schizoaffective bipolar 1 type. Obviously I have been extremely depressed for years because of everything. I can’t feel joy or fun. I can’t even enjoy TV anymore. I have never felt an ounce of peace of mind in my life. Every solidarity second is dread. I literally feel like I’m in hell and am cursed.

I feel so tired. I want to stop. If there is reincarnation, I want to be reborn as a pretty, skinny person that doesn’t have self destructive issues and keep friends.

i’m so sick of being alive,"i hate everyone. i hate myself. i hate being alive. and i hate it when you try to tell someone any of that and they give you reasons to not hate everyone, or yourself, or being alive. if i wanted a reason to be alive or to love myself or other people i would ask for one. i didn’t, because there are none. literally not one single thing on this earth is worth the amount of suffering i have to go through on a daily basis, and i honestly think it’s selfish and cruel anybody expects me to live like this.

you put a dog down because it’s suffering and quality of life is more important that quantity, so why do i have to stay alive and suffer in a constant state of frustration, depression, loneliness, and self-hatred? just because everyone else wants me to? that’s bullshit. it doesn’t matter if i make an effort to better myself. it doesn’t matter if i go to therapy, it doesn’t matter if i use coping mechanisms, it doesn’t matter if i have friends and family to support me, none of it matters because i don’t want any of that.

i don’t want to waste my life away in therapy sessions. i don’t want to waste my life away spending time with people that don’t give a fuck about me. i don’t want to waste my life away trying coping mechanisms that don’t work. i want to die, and i wish that people would understand that and let me go instead of trying to change that because, contrary to what literally everybody has told me, it does NOT GET BETTER and even if it will i don’t want it to. i don’t want to be happy. i don’t want to enjoy my life. i don’t want friends, i don’t want a partner, i don’t want any family, i don’t want to be able to genuinely smile again.

i’m not putting any effort towards getting better because i don’t want to be better. i just want to die already because being alive is so sickening. i hate everything about myself, i have absolutely no good qualities and i’m worthless. if it wasn’t true then i wouldn’t meet so many people that agree.

i’ve been waiting for so long. i’ve been waiting for the day where it will all magically get better. where i finally find a reason to live and be happy. where i’ll have friends and hobbies and i’ll genuinely enjoy life instead of endlessly suffering for no good fucking reason. but that day will never come. it’s not only that i can’t find a reason to live, it’s also that i don’t want to. i’m sick of wasting my time trying to be happy because it didn’t have to be like this. my depression has ruined my life and has destroyed any chance i had of being able to live a happy, fulfilling life.",Haunting-Tadpole9191,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12cspdq/im_so_sick_of_being_alive/

I'm tired of picking up sloppy wet poops my dog makes on the sidewalk. I'm tired of washing blankets and pillows. I'm tired of my sleep bein interrupted. I'm tired of buying pet products. I'm tired of stressful vet appointments. My back is tired from picking up the heavy dog. I'm tired of not being able to go on a vacation or a day trip without finding pet accommodations...which naturally means over the last 13 years I've taken the dog practically everywhere we go. And most of all I'm tired of not having any space from either of them (I can't even have personal time with my wife without a pet interrupting).

I'm just tired...and it makes me cry often.

Letter For Help,"To Someone,

Hi, my name is Kieran. I am 19 years old and my life is spiraling out of control. I am writing this in hopes that someone reads this and can give me some help or advice.

I am depressed. I have been depressed since 2018. I tend to deal with my depression in one of two ways: self-harm, usually by cutting or stabbing myself; in school, I used to stab myself with pencils and pens during class, and by eating a lot, to the point I feel sick.

I drink Mocha every morning. Usually, one a day but sometimes two because each box has 8 sachets and I like to go to the shop the same day every week. I kept this up for several years. The whole reason I started drinking coffee in the first place is because I heard it could help with weight loss. Recently, I have been drinking 5 or 6 a day. This means I am going to the shop to get more coffee every other day and every time I go to the shop I buy 30 quid's worth of junk to binge eat to cope with my depression.

Here’s an example of a regular shop:

8 pack of toaster waffles

Big pack of Doritos

Sour cream dip

Big pack of chocolate pillows

Honey yogurt

Tub of ice cream

Microwave pizza

Microwave burgers

Microwave pasta salad

Pack of chicken on the bone

If you cut out some of that it doesn’t look too bad but the problem is I eat all of it within two or sometimes a day. It’s an addiction. It’s not sustainable for my wallet because I work some shite low pay job and it’s not sustainable for my health, obviously. I am 50 Kg above the recommended weight limit. My family has a history of having crap teeth and Doctors have said if I don’t sort things out I’m likely going to have diabetes. I also really enjoy sports. I used to play football, I was on the school rugby team as well as long distance running and judo. I can’t do any of that now without getting exhausted within seconds.

I have been trying to lose weight for years. Tried the gym, couldn't stick to it, tried fasting, tried coffee, tried joining a kickboxing class, tried working as a volunteer where I lifted furniture and ran up and down stairs all day. Nothing works.

I think all the time about me having a heart attack in bed and my mum finding me or me having a heart attack in a public place. Me collapsing and dying.

My education is a mess. I haven’t been attending mostly because I either oversleep because of my medication or because when I do wake up I feel horrible and sick. My attendance is below 20 percent and the only reason I haven’t been kicked out is because I have EHCP that protects me somewhat. Whenever I go, I end up crying or feeling, as if I am carrying a mountain. I can’t relate to anyone. I feel so lonely. Every time I pitch something nobody listens or cares.

I feel like a failure. I was expected to get 7s in high school but instead I quit because I couldn’t get over some dumb girl who was leaving at the end of school anyway. Every dickhead I talk to just fucks me around. I keep asking if people want to hang out, something that is very hard for me to do. I am an anxiety riddled mess, and they can’t be bothered to get up for me, or they give the wrong phone number or some other shite. Why is it so hard just to meet up with someone?

I feel sad, alone and that there’s nowhere for me to go. I’m going to be some fat shit working some dogshit worthless job his whole life because he couldn’t just endure. I keep trying to lose weight. Nothing changes. I keep trying to make friends, nothing changes. I keep trying to be better but nothing changes. It's just the same circle of pain over and over and over again.

Your room is an externalization of your mind. My room is a mess. I have no clean cutlery left. I have no clean clothes left.

I want to die but I won’t because I’m scared. I am killing myself slowly, painfully. I’m drowning.

From Kieran

Thank You.",Ashamed_Produce,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12cc49a/letter_for_help/

Restarting Many Things,"Hello all, I’m wondering if anyone has any advice or can speak to what I’m experiencing.

My life was largely derailed by a 15 year battle with depression that started right at the end of college and a 6 year battle with PTSD during that time. I’ve been recovered for a while and I’m working towards getting started on a career and a life in general again, and it is just bizarre to be starting from scratch with so many things.

I have an MS in computer science and I’m happily married, but my last work experience was about 3 years ago and I don’t have references or a LinkedIn. I’m meeting with my state’s Dept of Vocational Rehabilitation today to try and get back on a career trajectory but I have no idea what my prospects are.

I’m stable and happy and I have good support from medication and clinicians, but I can’t get a job interview or any work, and I definitely feel pretty marginalized for having suffered from mental illness. Does anyone have any advice for me on getting my life/career going again? I really just want to get back to work and make a good life for my husband and I and put the past behind me.",Indie_Robolobo,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12cr2pr/restarting_many_things/

I can’t fathom the idea of working for the weekend the rest of my life, I’m trying to put things in play to where I’ll eventually be self-employed, but still life feels like it would be better if it weren’t there. I’ve been off meds for 4 years, felt fine, I’m supposed to get some new anti-anxiety meds tomorrow. But I really just wish my brain would shut off. The only thing keeping me hanging on is the thought of my mom’s face finding out I’m dead. It kills me. But I’m not even living.

Is this normal?,"I am mostly a quiet person, i don't show a lot of emotions and get a lot of remarks from people saying i look sad or too serious, that i don't talk at all. I have been underperforming in academics for almost 2 years now, from top 10 of the class in high school to bottom 10 in college.  Classmates don't approach or talk to me at all, i tried to strike up conversations but they never turned into friendlier or engaging one's. 
idk if it's just my image of being an underperformer/silent guy or me not actually having a personality.

I usually don't mind solitude but lately after almost and a year later, it's been kind of eating me up on the inside somewhere. Will my whole life be like this? Not being great at anything, getting brushed aside, no one to talk to on a daily basis(well, there's one school friend who i still talk to sometimes on call, he's the only one i have been able to talk like a friend for a long time).

Sometimes,
i feel like, my life after college would just be the same. Go to job, do work, come back home, makes me think would life even be worth living at that point. I don't think of suicide or anything, atleast not for now. I am a coward besides i don't want to hurt people around me who care about me so much, especially my mom and i feel like it won't be just from my side to give her that kind of pain. I wanna make her happy by being successful and stand on my own two legs, but i don't see myself happy in the coming future.

I wish if there were some way to just disappear from this world without hurting anyone around me, no memories no pain. Just gone.",RakeMeSenpaiuwu,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12cqzh9/is_this_normal/

Mental breakdown,Yesterday I shaved off my eyebrows,morphedtoes,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12ciw0r/mental_breakdown/
“Thank God you haven’t had kids yet”,"So the past couple weeks, I’ve started to realize it’s depression that’s my problem and not ADD. 

I’m in a computer science computer, and the work is all mental. So I suspect this has been a large reason as to why I’m not doing as well as I should be in my classes. 

I’ve fallen weeks behind, and it’s been hard to get out of bed lately. I don’t know if this was a mistake or not, but I told my mom about this. 

Her response has been practically “grow up” and “do the things you don’t want to do”. I’ve told her so many times I don’t think I have it in me right now to finish school. She just kept telling me to push through. I told her I don’t think that’s wise because I would burn out, as I’ve already lost a lot of joy in my work. 

I told her I would talk to a therapist, and I’ve planned to. I’ve even tried but there’s been issues with insurance. So I haven’t seen somebody yet. 

She’s told me I’ve been making the same mistakes for the past 7 years. That I just want to do nothing and waste my time (even though I have ambition). That I never listen to her, and that I hardly work. Even though I’ve been a seasonal full time worker ever since I was 13 (due to school)

Just today, she told me I was kicked out because she can’t watch me self destruct. I don’t lie, cheat, steal, smoke pot daily (anymore) or do any harder drugs like I used to. I’ve been slowly improving my grades, and since I’ve been to university my grades have dropped because the difficulty has increased. 

She makes me feel like I’m lazy and dumb, even though I know I’m not. When I tell her that, she just thinks I’m trying to be manipulative. 

She tells me she loves me and wants the best for me. That this is all out of love. But it’s hard to see that when she treats me like a child, says I have a terrible work ethic, and is genuinely glad I haven’t got a kid yet. 

I’m just not sure what to do. I feel numb, guilty, shameful, hurt, upset. Had some suicidal thoughts for the the first time in a while. And I can’t express myself to her because she thinks I’m just being manipulative, playing the victim and that I’m immature. I try to own up to my faults in our conversations, but when I pointed out how I thought she was overbearing she just got angry. 

I just want to lay down in my bed and do nothing but waste away like she says. I’m sick of her criticizing me, comparing me to my sisters, and having her be a brick wall when I talk about my emotions. 

I doubt she has the time or care to try therapy. She works three jobs as it is and thinks I’m the only one with issues here. 

Just needed to get that off my chest. Maybe get a bit of reassurance that I’m not just a lazy manipulative son who wants to do nothing with my life. It gets hard to remind myself I’m a good person that tries to push myself.",moderateleaningleft,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12ciljc/thank_god_you_havent_had_kids_yet/

I just want all of his to end as soon as possibile,"I'm M24, and have no purpose in life. Ever since elementary school, I have always been the best in school. I earned the highest GPA every year and even became Valedictorian. This is not to say I did not suffer my fair share of teenage awkwardness; as a matter of fact, I developed later than others so it's fair to say I used school achievements as some sort or compensatory perk. After high school, I decided to enrol in Uni abroad, as far away as possible from my family (my parents divorced when I was little) and, at least at first, things seemed to go well. High GPA, nice environment and I even started dating a beautiful girl which I later started believing would have been the woman of my life. 
Then Covid hit. I had to go back to my mother's place. I couldn't concentrate, i fell behind on my Exams and had to take a study delay. I started to go to therapy and eviscerated all the absolute rubbish I had to endure ever since I was a child. Physical abuse from my parents, my mother's drinking problem and everyone else's complete disregard for that 11 y.o. who was just screaming for help. So I had to take matters into my own hands and sacrificed the best years of my life, those where one ought not to think about anything else other than have fun and ""form"" one's personality and future prospects, only to keep other people's lives intact. No one dared help me out. And that is because, seeing I was so good in school, no one simply believed I needed any help. Truth was, however, that I never really asked myself what I wanted to to in life, never developed a passion, or an interest in something specific. Thus, I simply chose a Uni programme which could lead me as far as possible from my home, no matter the subject, which I knew I could crush, being the good student I've always been.
However, stuff's hit the fan I suppose, and I currently find myself in no position of going forward any longer. I have been in therapy for two years now, I have a two-year delay on my Bachelor which I find simply insufferable at this point, as I really want to have nothing to do with it in later life. 
I'm 24, I see my former friends/colleagues go forward in life, getting Master's degrees and working for companies, accomplishing themselves; people who couldn't remember the most basic concept in high school now becoming professionals, and all because they had the luck of living in families worth of Little House on the Praire whereas I had to be my own father, mother and annyoing teenager, all of this while trying to be good at school as well. I currently spend my days wondering around the house, with little energy to do even the most basic of things. Even cooking for myself has become too much of a burden. I cannot sleep unless I take sleeping pills prescribed by my doctor, otherwise I would stay up all night having panic attacks about what it will be of my life. Starting everything anew just gives me the creeps. I wasted 5 years of my life trying to escape and now I'm too tired to stand up and do it again.
I have given up on life in general, I see no reason to go any further and I genuinely hope something happens to me so that I will not need to deal with this any longer.",JustTiredofThis98,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12coe2l/i_just_want_all_of_his_to_end_as_soon_as_possibile/
Divorce; husband has a new girlfriend,"My husband and I are going through a divorce. We’ve been separated since mid January. It was my decision. I learned that he was talking to someone else. It triggered something in me and we talked and decided to try to work things out. When it came time for him to tell this girl, he called me and said “thanks, but no thanks”. 

I know deep down it’s for the best. Our relationship was…tumultuous. *TW* He was mentally, verbally, and physically abusive. 

I still feel empty. I feel lost. I’m constantly on edge, like I’m in fight or flight mode. My chest hurts and I can’t eat, I can’t sleep, I’m thinking about them together. What if he changes for her? I’m like a robot. It’s strange. I’m without feeling but also feeling too much.

I feel like an asshole,"It has been three years since I was officially diagnosed with depression and just recently, my best friend has been diagnosed with it as well. It sucks to see her falling into this depression pit because I know how horrible and awful it is but at the same time I also feel ""glad"" (I don't know what word to use to describe this feeling) that she finally knows what it feels like to be depressed and also maybe understand why there were times where I would cancel plans at the very last minute because of how sluggish and lethargic I felt at the point in time. 

I feel like a shitty person to even have such a thought as though I'm ""relishing"" in her suffering. I'm definitely in a slightly better headspace as compared to the first year of being diagnosed but I'm still struggling daily with self-harm urges and suicidal thoughts. I really want to be there for her like how she did when I was feeling down and stuck in a rut but I'm afraid of being a source of trigger. Also because I fully understand how it feels like to want to be productive yet feels unmotivated to do anything, I don't know what to say to encourage her. Sorry if this post is a messy read. I just feel so guilty.

The random late night breakdowns,"Since 2019 ive been dealing with my depression. Small random things trigger it, phrases, places and things. Ive been to the doctors, see my therapist regularly, take my medication. Lately though, I just keep breaking down at night. A feeling of sadness lasting for hours probably until I fall asleep. Crying for a few minutes to an hour. When I was switching between doses on my meds I had a real bad sobbing episode, a long hard cry. I joke around, love to make my friends laugh, smile and laugh around them and family, go hang out, but just about every night its the same when im alone. Just this alone sadness.

"New dad, I feel useless","I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety for almost a decade now. I have felt really good for a few months. My son was born a few weeks ago premature at 33 weeks. Seeing my wife cut open and her intestines out during the c section scared me. Hearing my son struggle and be moved the NICU and not being able to see him for a few hours and not know how he was is scary. When I finally saw him, he was hooked up to so many tubes and oxygen assistance. He got better really fast, but I can still hear him grunting for oxygen. He finally got to come home yesterday afternoon close to 36 week’s developmentally. I feel like I’m struggling to bond with him. I can’t understand how he is feeling when I hold him. When my wife, mom and dad hold him, he absolutely loves it and they all connect so well with him. But me and him struggle to connect when I hold him I feel like. He looks at me with confusion while he looks at others happily. I love him so much, but I’m so scared with every noise he makes. I browse through baby subreddits and it seems like the worst happens in those subreddits. It leaves me with so much anxiety. I’m scared of him getting SIDS or some other awful thing. I can’t sleep and I feel like I need to listen to every sound he makes. Im scared I’ll be asleep and not hear him if something is happening. I feel like a really crappy father who isn’t competent enough to raise a child and I just want to be a good dad for him and I feel like I am failing. All these feelings make my depression feel like it’s seeping back into me. Maybe I need to be medicated again. I don’t know. I’m a full time student and I’m already so behind on all my work and I don’t know how I am going to make up the work. Everything feels impossible right now.

No one cares is propably best answer,"And those who cares in their own ways could provide you with even more problems because in their minds there is even more chaos.
We can explain any kind of issues and colorize it So it heals, hurts, encourage, confuse. We always explain one thing in terms of another and that contribute to the complexity of the issues we are struggling with. My advice is action. Thats short and it reduces any irreducible problems pointing to sacrafice. Not gonna lie, to perform wise decisions about ""what action"", there is always element of gamble. Always folding will never make you WIN. Change is the hardest thing for humans. At least for me, personally.

"My depression has come back, but I don't know if it's from me tapering off SSRIs or from starting vaping. Any thoughts?","So I was on SSRIs (10mg escalitopram) for the past 4-5 years. I never really felt like they did much, but around 2 years in I tried going off them and felt horrible, so went back on a week later.

In the last year I've been doing really good. Motivated at work, organised in life, going to gym, interested in hobbies, etc. So a couple of months ago I decided to taper off the meds. Unfortunately this was about the exact same time I started vaping more and more. 

I have a super addictive personality, so when I started vaping I'd ALWAYS be doing it. Not just going out for a break to do it every couple of hours so. I'd literally be sneakily doing it at my desk at work. I'd do it right until I go to bed at night.

I don't know if there's a link between high amounts of nicotine and depression, but my common sense tells me it can't be good for mental health.

I had a horrible day at work today. Just that familiar foggy, no energy, overwhelmed, no motivation, negative depressive feeling that I remember from a few years ago before the SSRIs.

But I don't know if it's the vaping or the tapering off meds. Im going to stop vaping, I don't want to keep doing it. But I was also considering going back on my meds. I just dont know if this is the fault of nicotine, or the lack of meds.

Is medication the only solution to overcome anxiety and depression? Please Share Your Experience!,"For over 6 years, I have been struggling with anxiety and depression.. Throughout these years, I refused to give up,, I wanted to feel better and did everything I could to achieve this goal.. I did so many psychotherapy sessions, and read every book suggested to help with such mental illnesses, I kept a journal to write about my feelings and emotions regularly,, I told few of the closest family and friends and got some support during difficult times,, while I cannot deny the positive impact of all the above on my thoughts and mood, overall, I still go through very dark times when all I wish is for my pain to subside, even if that means life itself will end.. 

Two of my therapists concluded that after years of psychotherapy, I might need to be on medications for sometime.. the purpose of the sessions was to change the way I think and how I see the world and people around me.. they both agreed that I did well in that area,, but since there was no significant impact on my mental wellbeing , it is better if I start taking some medications to help me relax and feel less sad..

My dilemma now is whether to try more psychotherapy, or take some anti-depressants. The reason it is a dilemma is that I was on medications for a year before,, it was one of the best years in my life. I spent most of it being motivated to achieve things I always wanted to achieve. I was happy and content and able to put matters in the right context. However; when I stopped them, I went back to square 1. I was hoping that after years of psychotherapy, the root cause of the issue will be fixed and depression and anxiety will not be threatening me anymore. Unfortunately, it was not the case.

"I finally confessed to my parents that I want to kill myself, and my dad handed me a knife and screamed at me to do it.","I am a 15 year old male. I am ugly, stupid, useless, and no one enjoys being with me. I am struggling. I have always felt depressed, but its gotten so much worse in just the past few days. My best friend, who I thought I could always rely on, apparently hates me. I've found out from other people that she talks behind my back and insults me to her other friends. She acts like she's happy infront of me but has no problem insulting me when I'm not there. She was the only person I felt close to. I feel like I'm always the second, third, or fourth choice when it comes with people. No one ever chooses me first, but for a while, I thought that she might have considered me her best friend. Yesterday, I heard from someone that she doesn't want to be friends with me anymore, and that broke me. She was already becoming distant, but it still hurt. I cried the whole day. But obviously, I don't even have anyone to talk about it to. I'm not that close with any of my other friends, and my parents have never provided emotional support for me all of my life. I hate my parents so much. Almost every night, I cry myself to sleep because my life sucks so much. My dad always antagonizes me. He blames me for everything that is wrong. He says that his life would be better if I wasn't here, he acts like he is God and is always right, and he emotionally, mentally, and physically abuses me. I remember in elementary school, when he would get upset at me, he would punish me by taking away my glasses, and I wouldn't be able to see well the whole day until he gave it back. He exaggerates everything, and when I tell him ""no, that didn't happen,"" I'm giving him attitude. I get yelled at every week, but for some reason it still hurts. My mom is different. No matter what I do, she complains about it. I get a 96 on a test; ""Oh you need to study more!"" I try to talk to her about something; ""Stop arguing with me!"" Even worse, whenever my dad yells at me or hits me, she just watches, as if she's happy from seeing this. I try to feel sympathy for her because my dad yells at her too, but no matter what I do, I'm useless and selfish. My older brother is too ignorant. He's the favorite child. He goes out 3 times a week to hang out with friends, while I'm forced to study all day. They always compare me to him, saying that he never argues and never causes trouble. The thing that I hate most is that he never helps out my mom; I do. I assist with laundry, dishes, cleaning, cooking, and even massaging her, but they always say that I'm selfish and I don't ever contribute to the household. On top of all of that, I'm struggling with my sexuality, and I am really confused about who I like (also my parents are homophobic). Anyways, today, my parents yelled at me for stupid stuff, saying that I wasn't wearing pants to sleep and I took too long to come down for dinner. It almost always ends up in a fight, even if I apologize. But I was so upset already, and I was crying the whole day, that after taking up an hours of my parents yelling at me, saying that I try to cause trouble and play as a victim, I explode. I've never told them how I felt, because when I've cried about something I would be labeled as sensitive and they would just get angry at me. I really wanted to tell them about my ongoing depression and eventually I told them that I wanted to kill myself because I hated living. Which was true. I've thought about it all the time but never had the courage to do so. And my dad, grabbed the sharpest knife from the kitchen and forced it into my hands, and yelled at me to do it. But obviously I couldn't. I wish I did, to be honest. Everyone in my life hates me. I hate myself. I wish I wasn't born and I want to end my suffering. I wonder how my parents and friends would react if they found me dead on the floor. Would they be happy, or upset, or would they just not care? I heard burning coal in a room is the easiest way to commit suicide, from carbon monoxide poisoning. I'm really sorry for the long paragraph. I have no one to talk to.

Can I ask my depressed partner to not be unpleasant?,"My partner is suffering from depression and anxeity, and have been for years now on and off. Most of the time it haven't been that bad, but work related stress and then the stress of us having a baby little over a year ago have made it much, much worse. He is about to start therapy and SSRI, so we'll see how that goes. 

I have always really tried to be supportive and understanding. I pick up slack at home and with our child when he is unable, I try to let him be when he needs it, and be there for him to talk when he need that. I try to gently push him to do things thats good for him, like get out, excercise, socializing with friends and family, but not to force it. He tries hard to get everything done and be nice us, but when he is down (which now is most days) it is like a miasma of grey surrounds him and he is grumpy and irratable, making it so so hard to feel ok and normal myself. I try, both for me, our child and for him so he wont get worse from the guilt of making us feel worse. This is taking a toll on me, and I worry for how our small child reacts to it. So.. My question is as I asked in the title. Can I ask my depressed partner to try and control his mood outwardly? Is that reasonable or is it contraproductive?

I don't know what to do.,"I wish I had someone to vent to, I feel so empty just typing. maybe I do want someone. I always feel like just staying alone, but I guess I just want one person to understand me fully. I want them to know how I truly feel, as whenever I try to express myself to friends or family, I feel they don't understand the way I'm thinking and just try to explain that I should live a ""normal life"". I just want to explain why I feel this way without being criticized, I feel like I seem like someone I'm not, and it hurts. everyone's vision of me is the complete opposite. I feel so incomplete, I just want to finish everything I'm currently doing and focus on something I want to, I want to start a life, I have so many plans. I want to focus on myself, but with school it feels impossible. 
everyday I come home, I feel so alone. once I hear the door close and realize that I'm finally alone, I get a terrible feeling, like being sick or something. my movements are slow and I don't even want to do anything, I stopped eating in the morning so when I come home I don't have to clean and I can go lay down. I just want someone to talk to me.
I've had ok and off depression for a few years now, but it's starting to seem like it's not on and off anymore.
the thing is, I want to stay like this. it's hard for me to imagine myself happy, or in a relationship with someone, and I feel as if I don't deserve anything in life.

The invisible prison,"I'm 37 yrs old French immigrant living in Montreal, Canada. I had a relationship with the mother of my son for 10 yrs until September last year. I got custody of my son one week out of two, but I feel like my life is meaningless when is not home.  

All my family and friends are living in Europe but I can't go back since my son is here (In Montreal)  I feel  lonely and living in an invisible prison. I don't know what to look forward.... 

I used to have a therapist last year after my break up (for 6 month). We had a short flirt between January and February (4 dates) but it didn't work and now I'm without therapist, without family or friend and most of all, without my son. 

I really don't feel like opening up again to someone else (a therapist), 
I'm not in the the best moments of my life to make new friends,
I noticed that I got a depression. (I thought it was the breakup and that it will go away, but nope, shit is real)
I'm waiting for my test result for cancer April 12th 
I feel like my mental health is degrading by the day and I don't know how to stop this downward spiral. 

Any advice? I'm at a point where self-care, exercising and meditation doesnt works anymore.

Struggling to be more,"For the last two years, I’ve been struggling in a cycle. This time I have finally recognized it, but have absolutely no idea how to fix it. I’ve struggled with depression for about 5 years now(diagnosed at least). Waking up, getting out of bed, eating etc are all a struggle at times. I have come to realize a portion of my depression is from money issues. I have also convinced myself that if I magically come up with a brilliant million dollar idea, all my depression will disappear(which i know isn’t true). 

I hate my job, so i get a new one and hate that one too. I want to own a business, but at this point I think I’m so stupid to even think that someone like me could. The issue is that I come up with an idea and get beyond excited thinking i have finally found my way out. Then i attempt it and fail miserably. My depression slowly takes over at this point and i begin to give up, spending more and more days in bed, crying and hiding from the world. 

I’m 22 years old, and as much as i would like to think I have more value in this world, I’m truly losing sight of any value i have. I want to be more in this world, but how do i get out this cycle and get the motivation to keep trying?",MutedEntry4380,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12c7g83/struggling_to_be_more/
I can’t deal with this.,"I (18f) guess I just need someone to talk to. I recently have been through a very tough depressive episode that stemmed off some family issues. Instead of offering me support my friends at the time told me that they didn’t want to listen to my problems and if I didn’t listen to theirs I should Kms, and started bullying me after I asked for support. It’s been a few months and the family issue has been brought up again and that has brought up the feelings from my old friends and my family issues. I’m feeling more alone than ever and I really just want to not wake up in the morning. It’s spring break right now so I don’t have my normal support system. I really can’t deal with these emotions alone.",LizzyD430,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12c6y7p/i_cant_deal_with_this/

Why can't I just give up?,"I (24m) have been in a downward spiral for god knows how much time now. Every day feels like an uphill battle, even to get out of bed. I have felt like a completely worthless piece of trash for years, though I am not exactly sure why. Before I go to bed most days, I keep telling myself. Please don't wake up again. Please don't. Please don't. Please don't, but then I wake up regardless. All throughout my waking hours though, there is a voice screaming in my head: FAILURE FAILURE FAILURE. YOU'RE JUST A FAILURE. YOU SHOULDN'T BE ALIVE. Sometimes it doesn't even feel like my own voice in my head, I even refer to it as ""he"" or to that voice and me as ""us"" sometimes.

Despite all of this, I just kept pushing along, I never gave up, and by most metrics, I think I have been relatively successful in my life so far. I graduated from my University with honors and a 3.9 GPA, I got a good job after, and I then got a scholarship for graduate studies abroad, and I have a group of very close friends that I consider myself very lucky to have. But it doesn't feel like I earned any of it, and even worse that even IF I earned it, it's all meaningless anyway and wasted all my living years so far. ""After 24 years of being alive, what do you have to show for it? NOTHING because you are a failure who never did anything worthwhile"" is what I tell myself

The thing that has worn me down the worst, honestly, was the death of my father seven months ago. I just feel like I can't do this anymore. I feel more hopeless and more like a failure every day, and I feel like I can't open up about my feelings with anyone or ask for help anymore. I also feel a lot of guilt about the death of my father and toward the rest of my family, but that's another topic, I guess. I don't know what to do anymore and just want to give up on everything. I know that I am literally destroying my life and my future right now by my inaction. I should, among other things, be looking for a new position right now, but I am just too tired, and quite honestly, I am not sure if I actually care anymore. Maybe this, indeed, does make me a failure. Maybe I am just too fragile. Maybe I am not mature enough to realize how good I got it and how privileged I am compared to other people.

I just feel like my mind isn't my own anymore. I can't have a single moment of just silence in my head, and it's driving me crazy. I want to get therapy, but it's not an option for me now, and I just don't want to burden anyone with my problems. I don't know what this is. Am I depressed? Do I have anxiety? Am I just sad and being a little bitch about it? I don't know, and I don't know if it actually matters. All I want is to stop feeling this way. Maybe screaming into the void like this will help. I don't know.

Thank you very much if you took the time to read this. I am sorry if what I wrote is incoherent or not very clear. English isn't my first language, and I am not in the best state of mind right now.",BlueBlueWolf,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12cg5il/why_cant_i_just_give_up/
My father wants to end his life,"Tldr: my father has chronic pain (for about 15 years now) and severe depression (2,5 years). After a suicide attempt and almost two years of therapy and meds he still wants to die and wants to request euthanasia. He wants our support but I believe there is still much to fix and the depression is still very present. 


A little over two years ago we found out my father was having suicidal thoughts. My father got mental help, it turned out he was severely depressed and he received (some) therapy, sleeping pills and antidepressants. A few months later he attempted suicide with those pills. 

When we spoke with him in the hospital, he was going on about how he didn’t want to live in pain anymore. According to him, that was the reason he wanted to die. He’s had chronic pain for about 15 years now, the doctors said there was nothing else they could try. But after talking long and truthfully, we (my mother and I) concluded it was not necessarily the pain but the depression that pushed him over the edge. Because he had lived quite happily for many years with the pain. Also because he kept saying how he felt completely useless and like a burden to us, that we would be better off without him and so on. 
So at the time we made an ‘agreement’, he would get intense therapy (also willingly be locked up for a few months) to help him recover from his depression and learn how to live with chronic pain. And if after all of that he would still be ‘unable to live with this pain’, we would support him in his request for euthanasia (I basically agreed just to get him into therapy and I believed if the depression was cured, my father would be alright). 

Fast forward. 
Last Friday, when I was visiting my parents, my father asked if my mom and I could join his therapy session next Friday.
Because I myself also have a chronic illness, I unfortunately couldn’t truly involve myself with my fathers process up to now. This is actually the first time I have been invited to join him. 
A few days later I get a text saying he wants us to ‘think about his request for euthanasia’.. 

At the beginning it felt like he was making some progress but if I look back at the last few months he indeed hasn’t been doing well. His mood is terrible overall, but he’s also having lots of health problems. It’s a vicious circle of pain and depression making each other worse. One quote from a conversation with my brother comes to mind, my father said he ‘hadn’t laughed in two years’ (which, looking back now, was a lot more serious then we thought it was). This hurts me because it feels like he straight up deleted all his good memories! Yes, he has really struggled the past two years but he also had some good times. 

I am so scared of losing my father but also really angry at the mental health care system right now. I feel like they haven’t done enough (off course I would have to wait until Friday to find out what his therapist says about all this). It actually feels as if he just ‘sat out his time’ and now believes we will support him in ending his life. But I think there is still so much we/he/they (mental health care) can do! I would only ever agree with euthanasia if I truly believe he’s done his very best and there are no other options. Also I don’t even know if his request for euthanasia would be granted, since he’s clearly still depressed and depression can be cured.",QueenAngelica,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12cg260/my_father_wants_to_end_his_life/

Is it possible to break a heart so bad it can't feel?,"Today 3 years ago I watched my middle brother die in a ""perfectly beautiful horrible accident that couldn't be repeated if tried"" (quote from the detective). I watched as his life slowly drained from his broken and bleeding body and saw his eyes close for the very last time as he silently passed. There are 4 things about that day I will never forget: watching him fall after the accident, the hole in his body, his eyes slowly fading, and my parents breaking the news that he didn't make it to the hospital. When the helicopter took him his heart was still beating but deep inside I knew he was gone already.

I have tried dealing with this on my own since that day. The last time I felt any emotion besides the most primal (anger, fear, sadness etc.) was April 6 2022. My heart has built a wall around itself and doesn't let anything in or out. Random triggers daily bring awful mental images, but I push them away as soon as they come and distance myself from the emotions they come with. I deeply desire to move on from that day and forget about everything that happened but feel very guilty for wanting that. I am stuck in a cycle of suffocating emotion, feeling guilty for that, and then suffocating that too. To be honest, I don't think I WANT to feel those emotions, it felt like my heart was going to explode out of my chest and all of the images that come with them are awful. I can see them even as I write this post.

"23, chronic illness, no friends, no passion, just surviving each day &amp; feel so alone","I feel like I've failed at life. I have no friends, literally none. If I didn't use my phone for a week no one would bat an eye. I fell in love a few months ago but we ended things &amp; he was my only hope. I have nothing to do everyday, honestly. I'm in a few online classes finishing up my Bachelor's but it doesn't occupy enough time (I didn't take more bc I had a mental breakdown after last semester). It's impossible to make friends when I'm fully online &amp; never go to campus -- I have health issues that prevent me from going to classes, for context. I have nothing to offer, anyway. I'm sad all the time. I don't do anything new or exciting. It's draining to pretend that I don't wish I was dead.

I know it's probably wrong to think this way, but I want to just dive into nursing school or something. I want to distract myself from my own thoughts. I could also be independent that way. But idk if I could even do it because of my health issues. I know my intentions with that aren't the best (I love helping people but I'd be doing it as an escape), so if there any nurses here who can kick some sense into me, that would be great. I've always wanted to be a therapist but the thought of grad school &amp; everything that takes to get into that line of work sounds exhausting, &amp; everything is exhausting with depression.

Feeling disconnected to everyone in my life,"I feel so fake, as if everything I say isn’t something I would want to say, even if it’s a simple reply. Like I’m not speaking or acting as my true self around anyone. To be honest, I have no clue who I am. I feel a lack of connection to people, I have multiple groups of friends and in every one of them I feel so out of place. In group settings, I feel like I’m not listened to. Which then results to me being quiet most of the time and thinking negatively to myself, otherwise my mind usually just goes blank, completely empty, just focusing on what’s going on in the moment. My closest friends I feel that I can’t confide in them because I don’t want to say that I feel disconnected to them as I’m worried it would push them further away. I’ve resorted to emotionally isolating myself from my friends because of this and I really don’t think that my company means much anyways. I used to love making people laugh, still do, I have a friend who laughs with me at everything and I feel happiest when talking to them. I feel like I’m choosing to be this way but when I leave the house in a mood that I believe I can talk to people as myself that day, I completely lose it when I am surrounded by them. I hate this feeling so much but it’s been this way for a year or two. I often imagine what it’d be like to end everything because I’m so sick of this cycle of trying to be okay and crashing again, and again. But I still believe in a brighter future, I truly do, so I would never take action on my thoughts. I just want to cherish the people in my life without feeling this tension in my head.

Depression/ADHD ... Looking for similar experience,"I'll try to be as short as possible (I have some scoliosis so I'm 3 inches shorter than I was 20 years ago) . I take a low dose Adderall when needed + Celexa every day since a big mental breakdown 2 years ago. Started the Adderall 1 year ago. Celexa makes me feel like crap so I'm tapering under the supervision of my doc. Anyway, I've been on the lowest dose for about a month. Yesterday the big mental breakdown came back and crescendoed today. The experience is a complete lack of mental and physical energy. Every sound hurts the ears every but of light hurts the eyes... Every sensation hurts. Every thought feels like chaffing against my mind. And the thoughts don't stop, they speed up, random thoughts, clips of videos and songs and interactions. Exhaustion but cannot rest. Whereas 2 years ago this went on for 2 weeks until it put me in the hospital for 12 days, (where they hooked me on an antidepressant)... Today I popped an Adderall IR and half an hour later I feel completely normal again. I don't know what I mean to say here. I joined reddit because through the last 2 years of not knowing what in the assbutt was going on with my mind, reading everyone else's experience has been a lifeline for me. Being alone is terrible. I never really post but I feel like I can describe my experience now well enough that maybe someone else with a similar problem could find some comfort and not be alone. What this means for me today specifically is that I believe going after the serotonin was the wrong move and may have opened a little can of worms since going on the Celexa made me feel worse- to slightly better than crazy but never like myself again. But being on it so long is having that same effect trying to taper off of it. Going after the dopamine however was an instant fix. It's got me thinking that ADHD truly has been the root of the sudden super depressive episodes and that going after the ADHD might be my salvation. My Dr says there are ADHD meds that target dopamine and norepinephrine in the same way antidepressants target serotonin... So I'm eager to experiment further. . . I'll post this to r depression too. This is the ADHD Reddit so you know what ""the short version"" was going to look like. Anyway, any feedback with similar situations would be nice, especially if you switched to or added nonstimulants to your arsenal.otherwise I hope this helps someone who is on the brink.",Early_Thanks6643,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12c2stk/depressionadhd_looking_for_similar_experience/
"I was trying to keep myself together all day, but as soon as I got home I just started sobbing","I don’t know what it was today. I woke up late, but I was exhausted all morning. I didn’t eat anything except some granola bar. I was busting my ass all day at work because my coworkers are fucking useless as shit. I’m getting promoted but I still want to leave. It’s not enough to live anyway.

My entire shift I was on the verge of tears. I actually started crying at one point and had to get it together because I was the only one there. As soon as I got home, I went up to my room and just started sobbing uncontrollably. I’ve been crying for the last hour and just can’t stop. I can’t find it in me to eat or drink anything. I can’t get out of bed. I’ve been writing a suicide note in my head for the last 30 minutes, trying to figure out what I’m gonna say. I almost bought the pills I was gonna use to do it.

But socializing for me is so fucking difficult, its almost like I'm putting on an act and I have to act really funny all the time. When I'm in a conversation with someone I'm not enjoying it half the time because I'm overthinking every sentence I say. I feel like I'm keeping this act up of this funny dude but in reality I'm just this sad depressed piece of shit. Even with girls. First impressions are pretty good, and I've been on a couple first dates. But I always postpone talking to them again because I'm afraid the more they get to know me, the harder it will for me to keep up this act that I've made for myself. And it's not like I'm trying to be someone I'm not, this is just what seems to come naturally for me in a social situation. One of my biggest fears is being boring, so I try my best not to be.

I used to be so detached from reality that I would go for hours zoned out. I wish I could do that still but no matter how hard I try I'm stuck being counsious. 

Sometimes when I'm walking along a busy road I can't help but fantasize about jumping infront of a car. But they always avoid me by like 5 feet like ik that's probably the law or whatever but still.

The universe must love me, then why make me SO FUCKING MENTALLY UNSTABLE???

Motivation struggles with showering/changing clothes/staying on top of laundry,"I’m struggling with getting myself to shower daily, change clothes, and do my laundry frequently. I’m studying online right now so I’m at home much more than I used to be, which I think makes me even less motivated because there’s a lot less of an obligation to be on top of your hygiene when you’re spending most of your time studying alone at home.

And it doesn’t help that when I let my laundry pile up, I start to run out of my preferred clothes and that makes me even LESS motivated to shower and/or get dressed in something new, because I’m like “well I don’t have anything to wear right now anyway so might all well just not change”. So it’s just this cycle of not doing my laundry because I’m unmotivated, and then not having enough clothes to wear because they’re all just piled up in my room. 

I’m getting really frustrated with myself about this. I just need to get into a routine of showering and doing my laundry. I hate the feeling of wearing the same thing for days at a time and being showerless. I hate going to sleep on my bed knowing I’m not clean and I’m just transferring my germs onto the sheets. I get so grossed out with myself about it. But my disgust at myself has really met its match in my complete and total lack of motivation for taking care of myself. I’m so, so apathetic.

"I wrote this after a close friend commited suicide, I hope it helps someone!"," 

Hello Tomorrow;

Just wanted to touch base with you. As usual, I at times don't really trust you. You scare me a lot as I never know what your going to do with me, to me, or for me.

I always look forward to seeing you though, and don't think that will ever change, but I know others will disagree. So if you run across them, please send them my way so I can tell them about you. I want to tell them you really are something to look forward to. Tell them you really don't control what's going to happen to them. I want to tell them the truth, that it is really up to them to determine what you have in store for them, both good and bad.

Tomorrow, all in all, you have been good to me. I do remember times when I thought you were only there to kick me when I was already down, or just to rub salt into already painful wounds. Yet I also remember when others promised that I would never believe all the good things you have waiting for me. I used to think you were so unpredictable and could not be trusted. Now I understand there really is nothing more you want than to see me and have good things planned for me, especially if my heart is in the right place, my attitude is where it needs to be, and most importantly I focus on others before me.

So Tomorrow I will see you soon, and be grateful for it. I will think and pray for those who will never see you again. Someday I know I won't see you either. I do know when that day comes, I won't miss you, but be in a place where your no longer important. Until then I am grateful for you, but even more so to my God whom we both serve, for giving me back to you once again.

Let's both work together and show by example how good you really want to be to everyone, and put me to work to help in any way you need, and thanks in advance for including me in your plans. I'm going to sleep very peacefully tonight and awake ready to get moving to make the very best of whatever you have in store for me... thanks Tomorrow, and look forward to seeing you soon!",refuge333,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12c5fgy/i_wrote_this_after_a_close_friend_commited/

Tricking my self esteem,"
I'm soo tired with the same old pattern that I keep falling into, and it seems like I can't break free from it. Back in high school I was much more chubby, I was just the funny kid but never had a chance with the girls I liked, and it felt bad but thought on focusing on myself.  So when I started university, I decided to focus on my fitness and doing better in my classes. Over time, I lost 50 pounds, and I was proud of my progress and tbh felt as a stress reliever and felt more confident.


But then, I met this absolutely stunning girl in one of my classes as I was on my way home, and after we talked throughout the week it made me realize that my self-respect was still shit. The way she talked I knew she just talked to me as a friend but I romanticized everything in my mind and was desperate for her to see me the way I see her. 

It became frustrating and depressing that no matter how much I tried to better myself, I would still fall back into old habits wanting an amazing girl like her to see me in that way realizing that everything I did throughout the past 2 years didn’t do nothing for myself.",Puzzleheaded_Ad_3779,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12caes3/tricking_my_self_esteem/

i want to end my life at the end of my senior year of college,"i’m a current junior who is a year behind in my major (BA in comp sci) bc i have spent two semesters previously in the hospital from suicide attempts, which led to me dropping my major classes but staying enrolled in gen ed’s. 

Now i’m finished with gen ed’s and only have my major left but the courses left are the most difficult ones within the CS department. 

my school is extremely strict about graduating on time. they very rarely let students take extra semesters to graduate. so i’m going to be forced to take huge amounts of CS courses in the next two semesters and because i’m so behind and don’t have any outside projects or portfolio stuff i can’t land an internship before i graduate. so it’s very unlikely that i’ll have an actual job in my field if i do end up graduating and not failing from the overwhelming courseload

this current semester was the only semester of college where i was happy and had a college experience. i actually made some friends, went to a few parties, and generally did well in my courses. but in just a year i’ll be thrown most likely into a minimum wage job, which the ones i’ve worked before have made me want to kill myself extensively. and i’ll just be incredibly alone again. 

**i’m so sad to have to give up the life i lived this semester up when it was so short.** i was not happy at all during my time in college up until now, (as evident by my suicide attempts)

I think my lot in life is misery.,"Maybe that’s dramatic. Sorry for the “life story”, but this is gonna be a long one. But honestly, when does it end? I think it started when I lost my parents around two years ago. Both of them. Not at the same time, they died around six months of each other, Dad from cancer and Mom from poor health in general. 
My girlfriend at the time was an amazing support system. That is, until I came home from work early one night and found another dude in my bed. At least this was about six months time after the death of my parents, so at least she waited THAT long. I threw her out, and made her take the mattress with her.

About six months ago I fell really ill. Had to miss a lot of work, and the thing about missed work is missed paychecks. My apartment complex told me they’d work with me on rent then promptly filed an eviction behind my back. I had three days to move out, and I don’t have any family, any friends I can stay with. So I move into the one thing I have left: my car. While this is happening, I lose my job over missed days at the office for this illness, which, to be frank, is slightly a blessing, the job itself made me wanna snack on a bullet. 

At least I’ve got UberEats deliveries to fall on so I can feed myself and keep my phone on, but it’s not much of an existence, floating from drive thru to drive thru, parking lot to parking lot. So now I’m camped out in a Holiday Inn parking lot, typing out this stupid story, wondering, do things ever get better for me? I take comfort in the idea that maybe in the multiverse, there’s a version of me that’s wealthy, healthy, and married to Jennifer Lawrence or something.

Feeling hopeless about the future even though Im the problem,"I 29f was pretty happy in my youth. I had lots of close friends, a good family, and not much stress. I did lose my dad as a teen who was the most important person to me ever. That was tough but the rest of my family is good. Thats where the depression started - but University I was still happy bc I was surrounded by friends and didnt have to make decisions yet about a path. I have some friends but they are very different from me, I do not really have a best friend who I have lots in common with, like I have in the past. Ive never had a boyfriend, only a rly toxic guy who mistreated me on and off. Hes blocked now and Ive tried dating a few others with mixed results, but I mostly find that men don't take me seriously and Im always a second choice.

Because I am having no success in my personal life, I have poured myself into self discovery and finding meaningful work. I decided to do grad school since I didn't enjoy regular office work and wanted something that would give me purpose. Now I am doing unpaid practicum in social work where I deal with clients who have been through major trauma - all of the secondhand trauma is putting me in a bad headspace. I find myself wishing I became a nurse or teacher or something normal.

I always wanted to help people psychologically but now Im not so sure...I think if I had a good life outside this work, I would be in a better position to support these people, but how can I when I feel hopeless myself? And now have to know about every dark thing going on in the world. I wish I chose a simpler path now, and I have no money bc I did grad school. If this was the wrong move, idk how to start over. I still live at home with my mom. I try to date but guys probably get the sense Im confused about my career and that may turn them off. But my lack of a boyfriend and happiness or anything to look forward to is the reason I cant be present in my career. I feel my life path would be easier to determine if I was happy outside of work. Does this make sense? I feel like everyone has the main pillars of their life which are:

\-family (mine was shattered when my parent died - the most important person to me)

\- friends (mine are a bit immature and I feel ive outgrown them, all they wanna do is party

\-work (I still live at home due to all my indecision, have no money, and cant seem to commit to a path), I am behind compared to everyone my age

\-intimate relationships (Ive never even had a bf and have a bunch of baggage from being mistreated)

Am I just ungrateful? I feel like if even ONE domain of my life was going well I wouldnt be so miserable. I tell myself my expectation and mindset is so negative and if I started being positive things would go better - but tbh, I think that almost anyone would feel miserable if they were in my shoes. Does anyone have any words of advice? I find I feel angry and sad a lot now, nothing to look forward to socially or romatically, easily losing patience and losing enjoyment in activities I used to do. Would meds help?

isolation,"this life will stay in isolation, the way it has been for a long time. How could it be changed if that is all that's been known. Attempts were made at contact, but eventually it all came to an end. The contuined trauma prevents relations from being formed. Fiction feels realer than reality. It has been conditioned to feel like there is no hope out there. The abuse was driven in to expect no freedom, having been denied proper contact with the outside world. The isolation is tolerable but soul breaking. The only outlet is pain. Like all times, speaking will do no good. And cries shall go unheard. Truly it would be best for this to stop. Only existing of cowardice to snuff out this life. No one will truly care, we are to die alone. No friends, No family. Unable to feel love. Why live? Isn't that the point of life?

Without even consulting me first, my family got me two tickets for different showings of the same play (which my sister is performing a lead role in), so I could attend with both my parents and grandparents, at different showings, as they can't all attend at the same time because of schedules. I never signed up for this, and honestly could go without attending a single time if I could. I'm also a bit hurt that my family never bothered to ask me if I even wanted to go, but, as they paid for it, it would be rude to refuse and make their money go to waste. 

   Because of their inconsideration, I will have my weekend routine uprooted, lose a lot of time to work on schoolwork, and will have to spend more time than I'm comfortable with outside of my room just to sit on a hard, cold metal chair for hours, surrounded by mostly strangers, trapped and unable to get up, move, or leave, and also probably have to have uncomfortable conversations about my lack of a social life, motivation, and a significant other. 

I really wish I didn't have to go, and wish I could bring up the issue to my family without being made out to be a jerk for wanting to miss my older sister's senior performance and not wanting to spend quality time with family. Just hoping that I don't get a panic attack or a nausea episode.",Routine_Eye1444,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12c8kmn/feel_free_to_read_my_vent_and_leave_any_advise/
Why can my depressed friends still function,"Ok so I have a few friends that also have mental health issues, and Ik that they struggle with it all the time and stuff. For example my one friend hasn’t been to school for a couple days because of her issues. But thing with them is that they can still function and make friends and have a personality and have fun while around people. I’m the exact opposite, depression has taken away my whole personality, im not fun to be around, im basically a lifeless husk of a person, i have limited vocabulary and I repeat the same world over and over again because of how tired I am, when I try to make friends it fails because i drain the life out of people and no one really what’s to talk to me. Depression has taken away my personality and I hate it so much. And the thing is I haven’t told my friends I’m depressed, i just put up a fake front except it barely works because of the stuff I’ve listed before.

What depression feels like,"
Depression is a sickening emptiness that can turn any blue sky into a melancholic grey,

 It’s feeling like maybe there is a place called home somewhere, a place where you feel alive and connected to others, but it’s out of reach, it’s not meant for you, maybe you don’t deserve it? Maybe it’s too far away ? At least It’s not here.

it’s feeling like you have to carry this envelope of flesh while perfectly knowing that it will rot one day and wondering, what’s the point? Then you look around and realize : everyone will rot one day, and start to feel a creepling sens of nothingness. But  yet you can hear kids laughing and playing in a parc on a sunday afternoon, so there must be a point ? Those happy laughters and screams are just another reminder that there are in fact vast and generous  plains and fields of happiness, but if  others seem to be the characters of this authentic and joyful reality, you are a spectator and you are watching a movie. 

Depression is  being exhausted to care too much about what shouldn’t matter, and not enough about what matters. 

It’s looking at other people and thinking that they are in denial.., why are they so happy?are they crazy? Am I the crazy one? 

Depression is also , waking up one day and seeing how far you have come, and feeling that everything feels less heavy now. 
it’s looking back and seeing  that you were never broken, simply  a deep , beautiful and sensitive soul that felt like you were alone trying to cope in a dysfunctional society while in fact so many are aching in silence.",Former_Adagio9198,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12c19g7/what_depression_feels_like/

Everyone’s having a rough time right now, i know, and I’m not that close to anyone, not in daily contact with anyone, and I’ve stopped replying to messages. Haven’t posted on social media since fall of last year or earlier

I had a studio, but I moved out because I was too depressed to use it / didn’t want to invest in the space and my practice, didn’t trust I could ever make it profitable, couldn’t deal with the interpersonal dynamics in the studio. I threw out a lot of things I made, but there’s still more that needs to go.

Right now, I can’t hear it as much. However, on certain days it’s incesstent. Thoughts like I’m the most miserable person on this earth, I’m the biggest failure, etc.

My roommate was my best friend for 8 years and recently he molested me while I was sleeping. I thought I had a friend at work (she’s my manager) , but she ended up being on a power trip with me and kinda made me feel weird.

Negative Family Members,"I have some family members who are very negative.  I don't want to use the word toxic.

I try to not vocalize as much because growing up as a kid, things were never happy.  I never wanted to make it worse.  

I've been depressed for years.  Sometimes when I'm around these family members, I find myself sinking into a darker place.  When so much negativity is projected, it literally keeps me pinned to the ground.  

My mom has been making outlandish claims and I get worried for her mental health.  It just really gets me down.  My energy levels feel so depleted when I'm already at a vulnerable place.

I think sometimes I should distance myself, but I quickly change my mind.

Before we moved we lived in a huge apartment with tons of floor space and it was a 30 minute walk to my work. It was also a 5 minute walk to the local park where I would always go whenever bored/in crisis/whatever. Just a good place to live. 
However since we moved in to this apartment last September I have been miserable. We live on a college campus and the closest place is a 30 minute walk to a Walmart past lanes of fast traffic. It’s also in a really sketchy city I swore I’d never move back to so walking around by myself doesn’t feel like an option.
I told her these fears and feelings before we moved in but she swore it would be fine and that I’d feel better. Well that didn’t happen and now I feel more like a caged animal than ever.

One of my friends commited suicide,"Hi, I’m going to give some context to this. I had a group of friends I loved very much, but one in particular I considered my brother, and I love him no matter what. That being said, we had a very big fight 3 months ago and stopped talking to each other which made me extremely sad. He his not the one that killed himself though. In fact, he made me meet his childhood best friend several times, we went on vacation together, and kept talking a bit after our fight. That childhood friend was a very nice guy, and we actually talked 2 days ago about how we were doing although we hadn’t spoke in months. And today, I hear that he committed suicide last night, and I am one of the few ones that talked to him before he passed away. But I’m not sad for him, I know that if he did this, it was to end all the pain and all the suffering he had, and I entirely understand that.

What breaks my heart is that I cannot be there for my best friend, because he blocked me on every social media and texts. I tried to call him but obviously he didn’t answer. Eventhough we had that big fight, I would always be there for him, and I suffer so much knowing I can’t be close to him and do everything to make him feel better. Back then, I was always the one reassuring him, and being able to understand his pain. Moreover, he has lost his dad at 6 and now his best friend at 21, he must suffer so much rn, I can feel it in my heart but I feel so useless. 

I don’t know what I’m expecting by saying this, it’s not like you guys could change anything but it’s so painful that I had to share.

For information, I texted best friend’s mom, we talked for a bit and said she’d talk to him. I texted my ex-friend who’s still in contact with him (and also mad at me) so that she could tell him I’m so sorry for his loss. I wrote a beautiful letter for that friend who died and sent it to his girlfriend. I wish I could do more. I’m thinking about sending my best friend flowers with note saying that I’m here for him but I don’t know if it’s too much or inappropriate from me. What do you guys think ?

I dont know where it came from, but BOOM! it hit me outta no where. i still remember when i first experienced this. i was lost,sad, in disbelief. i never thought i would be the one. i didn’t know how to act. that pain just kept slowly eating me as every day passed by. i kept getting stomped on my this pain. it felt like i was dead but i could still function. there was no sense of happiness left in me. nor was the sense of love or excitement in me. it was like a robbery and the pain just stole everything away from me. and i never thought i would get my emotions back. and the only thing they left me with was thoughts. strong ones. i then begin to get sucked into darkness. no matter what everything i thought i got dragged into the pain. it was like everywhere i looked pain was in everything single thing. i felt alone like it almost felt like i was in hell. i felt empty inside i couldn’t feel anything. i was numb to the pain. as this pain kept going i begin to plot my whole life. it was like i was in a jail cell and i was bored of my mind. it felt like i was buried alive. just all alone….",Glass-Resort1816,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12bz6of/the_pain_pt1/
I am the living proof that everything that can go wrong will go wrong for some people,"Let me start with something to keep you interested. I was told 32 times in the last 2 MONTHS, yes I counted it, (each was a different person btw) that I am a failure and should stop trying to find love since I am so unlovable. 

Thats not were this begins tho. I am 23y, Male and never in my life had a kiss from a girl, never had ,a HUG from a girl that was not part of my famile or my friends and obv never had sex. Which may be a reason for my severe depression atm but thats def not all of it.

I got every single bad gene that my parents could offer. Not only do I look like s*it, i have so many disabilitys in my face alone that I lost count. Also for those that are interested this is  also a reason for why I strongly believe I will never have sex, since I have whats called a "" strong case of phimosis"" (btw dont look it up if you dont wanna see ""certain"" male parts).

I got a heartfailure which means that I can barely exercise and the only exercise that I can do is walking and not even that long maybe up to a max. of 2 hours but after that I can call myself an ambulance lul... so no exercising for me even though I begin to grow fat atm. 

I got bullied in school for my crooked nose and this and that you can imagine the rest. In my whole school life imI asked out only 1 girl. She was one of 2 that were my friends and didnt treat me like s*it. It was on our last school trip and I thought that if she wouldnt like me then who would ? She utterly rejected me. ""Ehm...no...youre a nice guy but no never... sorry"" I can still remember those words. After that she stopped talking to me. 

So I left school life and started working. Nothing serious I mean I cant even lift a damn box and carry it up the stairs ffs. 5 years go bye bye and nothing happens. Wasted time so to speak. So I tried dating apps, obviously wouldnt work but I can say I tried at least.

Now I was 21 and there was this girl in my class (I work at a school for mentaly and physically disabled children and NO im not the janitor, too my suprise they only take fit individuals). She was also working in that class. We talked and turns out we had mutual interests. 5 months after that, she suddenly quit and was gone. I couldnt even ask her out because I was too much of a coward.

At this point im severly deep into my depressiv state. I look bad. Have a bad character and have more disabilitys than some of the kids I work with. I was and too that extent still am ""DONE"" with my life. 

There is just no end in sight for me. In the next 2 years I ""existed"" or more tried to exist as too not burden my family too much. And now im sitting in my bed with a phone in a dark room thinking about it and telling my s*it that no one wants to hear probably. 

I could have written much more but I dont wanna flood this thread with more words than I have braincells, even tho that wouldnt be so hard ngl.

(Oh and if youre wondering those 32 replies of ""stop trying"" come from various friends which after they said that I removed from my friends list, and around 20 of these come from tinder replies and online chat room)",L_Hellion,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12c51n1/i_am_the_living_proof_that_everything_that_can_go/
What can you TRULY do when your depression worsens? After years of having it or are new to it alike.,"This could easily apply to the ""newly"" depressed as well. I've had depression (clinical level) on and off for 10 years or so. Mostly on. Mental health issues in general tbh.

I find it getting worse the last 1-2 months -- And thought to myself--What can I **actually** do about this from the standpoint of being seen by a health professional because that's what one should do when you start to get really bad right ? So that being said I concluded that (again from the standpoint of seeing a professional about it) there are basically option A, B and C

A. Go see a general/family doctor - Which will most likely result in them prescribing you an anti depressant / some form of medication.

B. Go see a psychiatrist - Which will most likely result in them prescribing you an anti depressant / some form of medication. In my experience psychiatrists do not do much ""talk therapy""

C. Go to some sort of mental institution (I don't even wanna think about what could happen in that case

(See a psychologist therapist but that's a process and a half so I'm talking more something that can get you out of the deep hole sooner than later before it gets to be too much to handle)

I'm aware we can try various things on our own such as changing diet / exercise / meditation and a plethora of other things and if u want to suggest those that's great but it seems to me that regarding professional assistance my A,B,C 's are basically all you have available to you...And we all know that that system is at the very least broken right ?

I'm very curious to see what people have to say / think about this. I kept the post as simple as possible for a reason - I just want your thoughts.

p.s And then there is the mildly existential D. Be rich and get some form of help the rich can get that seems to work much better but hey that's another topic in my eyes =).

Fear of Future Relapse,"Hi all. I’ve been here many times before in search of answers, relatability, and just being stuck in the despair with nowhere else to turn to, but this is my first time posting. I’m a m(36), with MDD and Anxiety. It’s been nearly two decades of dealing with symptoms, from mild episodes that last 1-2 months, to more severe episodes that last 6 months.

I got real help about 8 years ago, when I could no longer manage to hide it due to the length of the episodes, and I didn’t understand that I was dealing with clinical depression and anxiety, I just knew something was wrong with me that I couldn’t overcome on my own. 

Since then I’ve been put on numerous medications, I’ve changed my diet a couple of times, quit drinking, took up therapy, found a psychiatrist, and have tried to live a less stressful life with more boundaries and more mindful practices. I was able to ween myself off sleeping meds (trazodone for 3 years) and antidepressants (most recent fluoxetine) last year, after recovering from my worst bout with depression, induced by a failed medication switch (Zoloft) in which I experienced extreme side effects and withdrawal symptoms that made things much worse for me.

After 6 months of remission, I thought I was doing well, the best I had felt in a decade, and finally had found enough support resources to get me through if I were to relapse again, which I did a few months ago sadly. But this time really broke my spirit to keep trying. I’ve read enough here to know we’ve all experienced what comes with it, so it’s not news, but I’ve had all the major symptoms of anxiety and depression the past few months. 

I restarted medication, and it’s starting to work again, I feel I’m getting better now, but I’m still scared to try to pick up the pieces after this latest episode. I’ scared to dive back into my business, pick back up with my friends and family, try to take things to the next level with my gf. I don’t want the people in my life to have to endure another episode and I don’t want to have to disappear from society again. 

I feel like I have no control over the matter and maybe I shouldn’t try to pickup the pieces. I don’t know what living a life completely without ambition would look like for me, but I’m considering just laying low, not having much of a presence anywhere, and doing the minimum to stay afloat and get by. It seems like the easiest way to brace for the inevitable pitfall of another episode. 

Looking for advice from anyone who’s gotten to this point, where you’re scared or unwilling to try again. 

I’ve done this so many times now and I just don’t know if I can keep continuing to do so. But please, any advice would be much appreciated.",Ralenj,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12bpwjo/fear_of_future_relapse/

How I healed from killer trauma (the worst),"I was a teenager &amp; had to defend myself. An adult in a certain way of life tried to get me &amp; i got them back for good.

Ive had consultations with agencies &amp; they dont bother.
1, for what its worth
2, for the fact they are 9-5'ers that care about their time outside working hours..whilst this is my life

Many will not understand when you take a body, you carry it. Theres a knot in you so to speak.

I have lost my 20s where the most fun should have been. I have served a sentence despite being free. Over a decade.

The only help I have had is knowing this.

PEOPLE ARE IN PAIN, IRRESPECTIVE OF HOW THEIR OUTER WORLD/PERSONALITY IS PROJECTED.

Yes they may not compare to you, but having compassion for what may be inside them &amp; the value of existing is enough to help YOU.

I spent a decade assuming I was alone in my pain &amp; the truth is unless i go online, i wont find it in my environment.

I have found peace in being the compassion that underpins the woes in people. If they dont require such, so be it.

People would trigger me for so many years, trying to pick at the darkness in me for whatever reason &amp; i took the bait. Some say i intimidate them just with eye contact.

Coming from one of the most gruesome experiences that took a huge chunk out my life, my only peace now is being a LEADER.

my mum feels guilt because I have bad mental health,"So recently my mum admitted that she feels she owes me ""more"" than what she owes my brother because she feels she has done something wrong in raising me which led to me having bad mental health issues and not my brother. I see this a lot more now when she always wants to buy me things I like/want and feed me lots of food I like as her way of showing love and providing for her children as a mother.
But she will never accept who I am in terms of how I look/dress, my relationships and my smoking/drug habits. Which I can understand from her perspective but it's one of the few things I enjoy and have control of.
Now I do love my mum and understand she has had a very hard life after I was born and it wasn't her intentions for my childhood to turn out the way it did but she had no choice. I love her so much but we are so different but similar to the point we argue a lot, things feel like they're getting better but I don't want her to feel this way I just want a normal relationship with her my love language will always be touch, and I think she struggles with that but I do see her trying now. 
How can I make her feel less guilty for my bad mental health? I want to do family counselling but I don't think she will want to and I've been thinking of finding some support groups for her but I don't think she will want to.

I dont have a personality.,"My mood depends entirely on my level of distraction.  My day is highly ritualized, but also very simple.  I have a routine, and I stick to it.  If I don't stick to the routine, I kind of freak out.  My internet is off at home, so I cant sit in my chair and aimlessly scroll YouTube like I normally do after work.  I got really mad, and frustrated.  I dont want to go into great detail about why it frustrated me, but I feel like I pay a disproportionate amount of money towards utilities.  I shut down.  I sulked really hard for a few hours.  I finally relented and smoked some pot and relaxed, but I feel bad for getting upset, even if it may be justified.

Which leads me back to the original point, I don't have a personality.  My personality is whatever the people/person around me is.  I play off them, I mimic them within my own famously limited comfort and capability level.  I'm a dollar store weirdo.  If I don't have my chosen activity and my drug of choice, I feel like life is off the rails.

Get a new car? Someone hits it (while it was parked) at night on my street.

I graduate basic training? Oop, the day I come home I found out my gf cheated and ran off with that person.

I get a new gf? Lmao my brother wants to kick me out now for some reason.

Lately been struggling a lot,"
Been struggling a lot lately, depression hits for a couple reasons.

I always overthink. For example always think my friend is ditching me and I am only the second choice.
Someone I wanna hangout with really bad and I have been seeking out for the past week. Understand that he has some personal situation, today he logs on and played with another friend immediately claimed he promised him but he would still like to hangout with me and I am still his friend etc.

Idk if I am overthinking or not but I would like to hope I am.

There are some other sht going on in my life right now but it's all because I value people too much and treat them too well and expected the same outcome from them.
The bigger hope I have the more disappointment I have.

Cancer depression,"Long time lurker, first time posting. Please be nice. 

So I got diagnosed with breast cancer when I was 23; had to have all the treatment. Surgery, chemo, radio and hormone treatment. I put on a shit ton of weight from the steroids and stuff and never managed to loose it. They told me 5 years for the hormone stuff but at the end of the 5 years they said they would extend it to 10. I decided against that as the menopause, hot flushes, pain, worsening anxiety and depression was too much so they have started me on tamoxifen which tbh I find to be just as bad. Either that or I feel like I hit a point where I realised this is my life now. I think I might have been delusional up until this point, thinking time would make me go back to normal and everything would be ok but then one day February I realised it never will. I’ve really struggled these past 7 years and now I feel there’s no point. I left my job last year because I just couldn’t do it anymore, my mind has slowed down and I’m just so unreliable as 3-4 out of 7 days a week I feel terrible. I’ve spoke to my oncologist, doctor etc but there’s not much they can really do for me apart from alter treatment etc. I feel like shit for even complaining about the treatment cus I know people have it way worse than me and they don’t even get a chance. I don’t really do anything anymore, I just sit in the house and do laundry and look after my cat and husband and I am just barely managing that. I struggle to talk to anyone in my life about it so now I’m turning to strangers on the internet lol. I don’t even know if this will get seen or if anyone will even comment but at least I tried.

"Tw: s3lf h4rm, su1cide/su1cidal thoughts","People have worse situations than me but i still can’t feel anything. Sometimes I finally do feel something, but it’s only the loneliness guilt hopelessness sadness that was here the whole time. I know it’s here. I know it’s always here but I really can’t feel anything else other than those. I can’t even feel calm because it’s always emptiness instead. I don’t understand. I’m not as sad as others. I don’t cry as much. I go through less than anyone else but I still can’t get rid of this pain I don’t know how to explain but that heaviness but also nothingness inside is eating me up. 

I always try to find something I used to enjoy doing to do to distract myself from everything but it’s no use. It’s not leaving me alone no matter what. I can’t just snap out of it and ignore it, but I can’t sit down and sort things out either. 

I always feel like I pass by every day just like getting stuck in those time loop, repeating over and over. It’s so tiring. I can’t understand the world I used to anymore, I can’t feel anything for anyone. 

I always skip school months ago. Now everyone said I have “progress” since I attend more classes compared to before. It doesn’t make sense at all. If I have more progress I should be feeling better right? I’m not feeling better at all, in fact it’s getting worse every day. 

I used to hope that I can get promoted to the next grade for school because i wanted to stay with my friends. I know they are my friends but I still feel like they hate me, I also just don’t feel the same wish to get promoted and get better from my mental health anymore. I can’t do anything anymore. I know if I need to get into the next grade I have to study properly, don’t fail my classes and also attend more classes but I can’t anymore. I don’t want to just seeing myself lose everything, but is there any other way? No. If u can’t do it, u have the consequences and that’s just reality. 

My ex best friend used to always comfort and encourage me and that’s probably why she left, it’s tiring. She always told me she will never leave me. I know that it isn’t true, I always knew that but I still tried to believe her despite knowing it’s a complete lie. She has new best friends now and she is much happier without my negativity and draining presence, it hurts a lot but it’s ok because she’s happier than before. 

I’m trying my best to keep clean from self harming but I really can’t anymore, every time I see my scars I feel very guilty but the urge to do it again just rises as well. 

I really want to die. I want to end it all. Yes I will lose what I already have but it’s too painful I really can’t hold on any longer. But why am I like this when I have so much? Much more than most people do? Why am I not happy at all? Why is it so painful?",ihateveggiesandwater,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12bqgpo/tw_s3lf_h4rm_su1cidesu1cidal_thoughts/

Dear grandpa
Hey, it’s me… I know it’s been two years and people tell me that I need to get over your death. I can’t. It’s just there are days that I forget that you’re even gone. That you’re going to call me because the sun is out and you want to go to the lake. Remember how it felt in the sun? I remember you coming over, picking me up and taking me to the lake for hours. Even when you didn’t even want to leave the rocking chair, you still took me. I always remembered you calling yourself, “strong like bull”. And I never understood why you call yourself the bull and I’m so happy that I can say that randomly and nobody will understand either. You took care of me. Showed me that I can still do anything when my life is falling apart. There was days where I had zero understanding of what you wanted to say because of your accent. But I always knew when you wanted to beer. The family is not the same without you. Christmas, Halloween, my birthday, and the first day of summer will never be the same without you. It’s weird that you’ll never see me graduate, get married, and have a baby. Hey grandpa, my sister is pregnant. You would be so happy of the woman she is. I know that you would love to meet your first grandbaby and I’m hoping that some weird way you already met them. I hope you love who me and S (my sister’s first letter) grown up to be.

I tried reaching out to friends about how bad it was for me. Lost two friends,"Edit: I'm very thankful for all the support in the replies, you guys seem very kind and I wish you all the best and for things to get better 

Yesterday I tried to reach out and ask for a listening ear from friends. I'm 22 female and they are both male if it's relevant.

Both seemed pretty annoyed, first one didn't even listen to my issues, told me there are worse things and people with worse lives and it's all in the attitude, then proceeded to ignore my angry messages probably signaling to me that the friendship was over.

 Second one flat out said ''listen I'm busy and i'm not sure what you want me to say'' in a very dry tone before hanging up (this was as soon as I let out a single sob)

I was under the impression both were close friends as I've known them for over 5 years but it seems they were only good times friends, I don't have a history of reaching out and this was the first time I brought up suicide. I ended up blocking both and having nightmares about it.

I realise I sound annoying and hypersensitive but I just didn't expect that would be the reaction from friends I thought cared about me. Seems like no one cares if I die. I'm sure that's true and they would just put the responsibility on me and think there was no way to help someone who doesn't want to help themselves. I'm really tired of people being not only dismissive but openly rude if you're ever suicidal. 

I'm never reaching out to anyone about anything ever again.

There's no point.,"I had 3 essays to write for uni.

I haven't felt disappointed like this for a long time. It physically hurts too because I've never known what I wanted to do with my life, which gradually aided to suicidal thoughts/I have no purpose etc. but then one day I realised that I wanted to teach modern history to high school students. I have been so passionate about this dream, and so dedicated to it for the past 3 (ish) weeks, absolutely thriving off of the high of finally figuring out my purpose.

But i usually get depressed when things change. I have been depressed for a few months now. I struggle with getting myself to eat and other basic self care tasks when I am depressed. Today I went to Safeway to find basic ingredients to make food. I was in baggy clothes and beat up converse and my tangled hair that I haven’t brushed in a month tied together in a bun. I decided on pasta since its an easy meal and my favorite. I was by the pasta trying to find the will to make a decision when I was approached by a lady. I am an introvert with social anxiety this single interaction is already throwing me off of the trip. She walked up to me and told me I look like I need help and she has two suggestions for me. One pasta has two many calories I should go find a salad in the produce section and two my hair is really tangled and should take better care of it.

Yes, I retraced my steps, looked in the last place I used them, asked people if they’ve seen any headphones around… nothing. They’re lost and at this rate probably won’t be found. 
I’m at a loss. $200 Beats headphones just went down the drain. Of course, I can’t afford to buy new ones due to some situations. 
This might sound silly to some people, but those headphones meant a lot to me. I used that high-quality, noise cancelling sound system to block out the world with peaceful music I could listen to that gave me joy throughout the day. I took good care of them like they were rarities. They were simply precious, sentimental objects to me. But now, since today, they’re completely gone.

I feel like I’m out of options,"I had a psychotic break back in 2017 and I’ve been struggling to get my mental health back in order since but nothing is working out for me. I had my episode during my first year of grad school and was able to finish my degree but I still can’t find work (I have a background in the arts and want to break into data analytics). I’m trying to find minimum wage work but my ego gets in the way and I feel like everyone can tell my heart isn’t in it. 
I was living in an abusive situation up until early January and now a good friend is letting me stay with her and her boyfriend and I’m so thankful for their kindness. But being unable to find work makes me feel like such a drain and with the after effects of the abuse, everyday is a struggle. I take medication but, due to circumstance outside of my control, it’s hard for me to get. I feel like if I can’t find a job soon I’ll have no choice but to end things.

So much is going through my head right now,"I have no joys in life; I jump from hobby to hobby, passion to passion, yet every single time I feel like I'm trying to be someone I'm not. I can't find my purpose nor what I even fucking enjoy in life, and that's led to me feeling incredibly lonely. The irony is that for me to find like minded people I need to find something I enjoy, a niche, a hobby, fucking anything. And I simply can't seem to find anything, and so when I'm hanging out with people, I can never truly connect with them because I don't even know myself, what do I like? Well I know what I dislike but you can't use that as a basis to find friends or you'll just end up with hate filled people.

I feel like a contradiction, I'm very introverted and yet I feel like I need people, I used to find pleasure and relief in being alone, now all I find is loneliness. It's like I've become allergic to my love of being alone.

Not only that but I'm INCREDIBLY stressed, for some reason this year of Uni has been torture, everything feels overwhelming. I had a 3 day excursion the other day, but because of bullying\* (wasn't really bullying, but instead targeted banter without reprieve) and also being overweight and the excursion involving ALOT of walking, I ended up going home a day early knowing full well I will need to get special consideration for missing part of the associated assignment. Easier said than done, you need some sort of evidence that your telling the truth, aka a letter from a registered psychologist/doctor... good luck getting into one of them on short notice. so now I'm stuck with the repercussions of being mentally unfit in a world that doesn't like unproductives. In all likelihood I'll fail that assignment and have to repeat the course, brilliant for my wallet and mental health.

I don't want to die, at all, I know this will pass, but I feel like it's going to take energy I don't have and patience I can't afford.

Don’t know if adderal (as prescribed) would help my problems,"

Often I feel very tired/too calm and in situations such as work people may think i’m disinterested because I don’t have a lot to say and i’m too relaxed, I genuinely don’t have the energy when it comes to talking that other people do and my voice comes off monotone (to the point people ask if i ever get excited) though i am very nice and interesting if you listen to my words, my tone just makes it seem less interesting. When i’ve done stimulants such as occasional coke, adderal, molly, my energy for stuff like that goes way higher and my anxiety goes away for the most part and helps me to talk in a more exciting way/think of topics to talk about easier. It’s very hard because I want to be more outgoing but don’t know where to start, even my girlfriend has thought i don’t want to talk to her but in reality i don’t always know what to talk about and i get scared i won’t have a lasting relationship because i’ll get boring after having talked about my usual things (we were on perks tho and i like to just relax and she gets irritable sometimes so that could be why she got mad)
I’m not sure if the problem is anxiety, or another mental health issue or if it’s something i can work on and don’t know if I would need to be prescribed something or if therapy would help better, any advice is appreciated, thanks.

My whole world crashed,"TLDR: One incident destroyed my confidence, all the relationships in my life and nearly ruined my career.


Suffered with depression and anxiety for years, which was only addressed recently, (didn’t know I had it, I thought everyone felt like this as they got older).

My parents really helped me and I opened up and tears of bottling up emotions came out and it took about a year, but I began to feel happy and relaxed, something I hadn’t felt since a young teenager.

I excelled in my career, found some ‘genuine’ friends, found a girl whom I thought was the love of my life, found respect from my family and colleagues.I felt amazing, untouchable, confident, carefree and above all else happy with life and myself.

This continued for about 8 months, until I got a new position in another company. Initially things went well, but my collègues were heavy drinkers and one night invited me to go out with them.

I initially said no, then yes and then my girlfriend rang telling me she wanted to spend the evening FaceTiming. So I told my collègues no.

One collègue in particular, the ‘ring leader’, became really irritated with me, shouted at me and slammed the door in my face. (We we’re in shared accommodation). Everyone followed her to go out.

From that moment I felt like my whole headspace collapsed. I felt my confidence drain away from me, I felt cold and I felt my world get very small.

I spent the evening in some sort of anxiety lockdown where I couldn’t think and my muscles started to tense up, it was like being back to how I was before addressing my anxiety and depression.

My relationship with my new colleagues deteriorated and I ended up quitting. My relationship with my girlfriend deteriorated and we finished it. My friends stopped calling. My confidence and happiness disappeared. 

The world seems cold now, I don’t feel a part of it, I don’t feel connected to anyone and feel like everyone is a threat.

I have no desire to make friends, although I know deep down that’s what I want.

I feel angry, dead inside, self loathing, bitter and frustrated and just want to wake up feeling stable, hopeful and with self love again.

I try everyday, I’m back at my old job where things were going well, yet my old friends/collègues don’t really interact with me anymore. I’m treated like an outsider, maybe because they can see how depressed I am, even though I try to hide it. 

I don’t know what else to do really,  I’m on antidepressants and exercise etc, but all I want to do is curl up and wake up 6 months ago when my mental health was good",Hot_Refrigerator89,9,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12bv33t/my_whole_world_crashed/
I feel like a giant asshole at work.,"My new manager, my boss's boss, wants to chat tomorrow due to an issue this weekend and an email I sent. I need to have clear unemotional thoughts and words for this talk. I don't want to point fingers at others, I want to talk about myself and changes I can make.  God, I so don't want to cry in front of him. 


Like everywhere nowadays, my job lacks staffing, plus a lack of training for the ones we have. I took a significantly lower position with the mindset of taking classes and changing my direction in the industry, of course I dropped my plans as soon as overtime was available. Now I've been working 60+ hours a week, in multiple departments for months now. The money of course is good, but 48 of those hours are overnights by myself, and three days a week I do 12+ hours. Sadly this job feels like all I have. The only people I see are coworkers in the am, and I'm of course chatty and everyone at my job is gossipy, me included. I do think because of not having a personal life or friends I see, I over share and am putting too much on coworker relationships. So keep that all in mind. 

This past weekend I asked in a group text who wrote a note that was left and the reaction I got was significantly more aggressive than I expected for the question. I got really upset, cried on and off that people saw. This person going off on me was a long time coming, so much so that I talked to and texted with my direct boss about the way this coworker can be with me at times, even asking for meetings/conversations to be had. Another part to this that I've only realized in the last 24hrs, is that responsibilities and tasks my boss has put on me, that I have been told has been communicated, has not. So when I've asked for meetings/conversations to communicate what the game plan is and what my role is with the needed people. With the specific intent to not seem like I'm overstepping or shitty on others work, but that communication never happens and I'm told people know. The results are me getting upset because that coworker goes off for me asking a question. Now after days of crying, overthinking and feeling like I'm the problem. I have another coworker tell me basically most coworkers feel like I overstep and don't understand why I'm involved as much as I am, this coworker was nice enough to say I clearly know what I'm doing but that I shouldn't care so much. 
I feel like my boss has misled me, because she has asked me to send emails with instructions, to communicate errors, placing orders, responding to customers, handling accounting stuff, the other day she asked me to help her write another employee up. I have asked to have meetings/conversations with her, which never happened. It is not uncommon for her to be at work when I come in. At that hour she's typically trying to get work done to go home. She also has taken this time often to vent to me about her struggles and frustrations with her job, including talking about coworkers and managers that are above me. I feel like I'm supportive to her, telling her yes she has too much on her plate, no she shouldn't feel bad when she has days off, and I also tell her to ask for a raise all the time. Communicating with her is hard too. Many times I'll ask a question and get a long winded answer that I have no idea how she got there. I know I've come off rough to her at times, I think she feels like I don't think she knows what she's doing but it's more that she complicates things and adds unneeded steps, when simple changes and instructions are going to go along way at this job. Plus I have created some of these resources and offered to do more, but I'll send them to her for review, I get no feedback and nothing gets implemented so it feels like I'm wasting my time. 

So I feel like a giant asshole. My intentions come from a kind place, and I really believe my job needs teamwork and more people working together instead of everyone doing their own thing.  I'm sure part of the issue is I'm thinking like a manager when I've taken a lower role. I know I'm the problem here and because of that I really just want to quit. I feel uncomfortable and I don't want to be there. Of course I have ""issues"", anxiety, depression, trauma, adha. Additionally my therapist pointed out today that I'm searching for love and validation from my job and coworkers. I feel like the curtains have been pulled back and everyone sees me for the crazy unstable loser I am. I just want to hide. I can't quite but I started applying but my work history sucks and I'm applying for manager positions while being hourly, I don't even know if a management position is even right for me.",funanddyslexic,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12bv2k7/i_feel_like_a_giant_asshole_at_work/
I hate how my menstrual cycle affects my depression,"Hi all, first timer here. I'm hoping that at least a few people can relate to this and suggest ways to help. I'm 22 and it's been less than 2 years since I've been diagnosed with depression and less than a year of me taking my meds. I mention all of this because maybe I'm just rushing myself and I need to wait a bit before things get a bit better. When I talk about it, I mean my depressive episodes when I'm PMSing and during my period. During these depressive periods, I feel so so lonely, I am so tired and I fucking hate it.  Everything is such a trigger, and it sends me down this deep spiral and before I know it, I'm somehow at the bottom.

It's not like I don't try the other non-medicinal methods of dealing with my depression that my therapist and psychiatrist have recommended, I swear I clocked more than 10 000 steps today, in the really nice green, grassy areas of campus ( I love green, I love green trees and green grass). The past couple of mornings leading up to my period, I made sure to take cold showers in the morning to reduce my anxiety and start my days right. I feel like I try so many things to keep myself moving during these times and yet I'm still sitting in my room struggling to catch my breath cause I just can't stop crying.

I don't know what to do.,"I'm not good at English but I'm gonna try my best. I (23M) have been depressed for several years. To provide some context, I was bullied at such a young age that I became mute for half my life. It doesn't help that I have abusive parents who are not really supportive of me as a person no matter how many times I tried talking to them. I've made many acquaintances and friends along the way over the years. However, I have lost a lot of friends in the past year and the only people that I have talked to are those at work. I have tried to reach out to a few close friends of mine but they are too busy to talk and struggling to get their lives together. My favorite general manager at work recently informed the staff that he had been forced to relocate to another store because the store was in desperate need of a general manager. He noticed that I had been feeling off for the following weeks and decided to talk to me because he knew that I needed help despite how different I treated him compared to others. To this day, I still don't understand how he noticed when I did the same thing every day at work over and over. His superiors decided to pull the string and send him off to the other store the week after our discussion. They ended up leaving us without a general manager for a month or two and not informing any of the staff of the situation. Apparently, it was their best course of action on their part but we all thought it was a bad idea because we had no one to guide us at work. After he left, I continued talking to my general manager outside of work and got myself a therapist so that I could talk to them about my feelings. It's still hard to this day because I miss him so much. He was the only person with whom I was looking forward to working alongside some other people. My workplace is a toxic environment, and most of the managers here don't really care about any of us no matter how many times we try to talk to them. I recently stopped talking to my general manager for almost three weeks now and it doesn't help that I haven't been able to talk to my therapist for two weeks now due to certain circumstances. I still want to talk to him and be friends with him, but my past experiences with people are holding me back because I'm afraid he'll hurt my feelings more than I'll hurt his feelings in the future. I'm also in that mental state where I care more about others than I do about myself. I've been trying every day to keep moving forward for the sake of others. I understand that talking to people can help me break the cycle of struggling to speak, but I still feel like giving up sometimes because no one really cares about me. All they do is listen and disregard what I had just said to them while continuing to use me as a toy to play around with. I'm gonna continue trying despite how much I wanna off myself.",Karaagedamame,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12buxxp/i_dont_know_what_to_do/

Depression and how it affects my cognitive ability,"It took me a while to come to terms with it, but I (19m) genuinely think I'm depressed. I constantly push down my emotions, and sometimes I wonder why I don't feel like anything. My friends in college who go through stressful situations, and ones that affect us as a group has no meaning to me. It does not feel real, nothing that happens to me affects me in any way. By this I mean, I realize that there are so many consequences of my lack of action and attentiveness, and I realize what will happen if I fail, but I can't seem to push myself out of it. Most of my life feels like I'm looking through a lens, It's like everything in front of me is just being watched by a spectator, there is nothing in my life that makes me feel like anything, I end up doing what I want and it hasn't been good for me academically. I can't ever sit down and focus on anything, I wake up and I feel nothing inside of me that wants to get up and do what I have to do. 

The biggest and most recent change in my life is my girlfriend, and truth be told I've ended up being at a spot where it has gotten in the way of me, my friends, my grades, and overall independence. She doesn't ask much of me, and it's been healthy, but I can't stop myself from clinging to the realness and how genuine it feels to be with another human being that can sit there and give me the warmth I've been lacking. I know I'm not supposed to get into something when I am unable to stay happy myself, but my feelings have been heightened when I got into this relationship. 

It made me stop and think how I can better myself, but I have been so forward and into nurturing what I have. Now that I feel something, I hate having to go back with my same group of friends, back into my dorm, and having that lingering feeling of emptiness hang over me. 

The reason why I am writing this is because my friends have described me as someone living in ""4D"". I don't take much into account, since I never feel much in the first place, everything that happens to me and the way I react are my genuine reactions. Should I take a step back and change my thought pattern to be more patient and gauge what is going on before I react? Should I stop and think about what my consequences are? These things all scare me, every time I stop and think, the first thing I do is push it down and say it will get better, but will it truly? I want to face who I am. I want to be the person I want to be, but how can I do that when the person I am is someone who gets so frightened off of the slightest feeling? 

As I write this, it feels like my life is crashing down. So many thoughts are racing in my head. Am I ready?

I don't know how this sub works, maybe this post wasn't meant to be in this subreddit. But I just want an answer to all these questions that I myself am not ready to face. I am afraid to talk to anyone. I am afraid to talk to my friends, and I hate to finally face the truth and tell my therapist when I cannot even be honest with myself.

I’ve been sad for as long as I can remember. ( I’m in my 30s now). Sometimes I think I came into the world like this, just deeply painfully sad.

It messes me up with everything I try to do, I find myself losing things, dropping things, crying, anxious and worried.

I swing sometimes where I will feel better and tell myself life is too short to feel this way but my brain just falls right back the second it senses the relief of happiness.

I have felt deflated and dim since awakening at 9.30, and sat on the couch working on a paper, stopping to take breaks and play animal crossing in between. I just felt I could not leave the couch.

I went to lay in bed at 18.00 when my partner encouraged me to go for a bike ride through this charming, peaceful little park we live nearby home. The sun was beaming through the early spring leaves and the grass was vibrant, children were playing, dogs were prancing. Throughout the whole ride and all of these peaceful elements, I was struggling to pedal and move my bike. My expression was flat and my eyes were sleepy, wandering, unfocused. It was incredibly sad to feel such a heavy depression on a blossoming day. I described to him what a disappointing tragedy it felt like and explained how I feel this often, but today in the thick of spring it felt especially apparent.

"Something feels unhinged, but I can't seem to pinpoint what.","I've been struggling with depression for a couple of years now, had my ups and downs. Some days recovery seems possible, and on others it feels pointless to try. Sometimes I feel almost afraid to recover from this illness because I don't know how being ""normal"" feels like anymore. I am afraid of what I will lose after I gain it I guess. 

I've had periods were I felt completely numbed and hollow, where I did not particularly feel bleakness or that existential dread. It was just a whole phase of emptiness and I felt more afraid of that feeling of nothingness than anything else then. I've also had periods where I was immensely suicidal, constantly thinking about escaping instead of facing my problems with therapy or medication. I've had sudden surges of hope out of nowhere, looking for new ways to get better and even clocking in some movement instead of lying around the house all day. 

However, recently I feel off. It's a new feeling that I've never experienced in my years of battling with this condition. Something just feels amiss, as though something that was holding me together came loose. It feels uncertain and frankly unstable. Yet I've had no physical reaction to this feeling. I can still get myself out of bed to get some work done and even socialize with people. I haven't ""broken down"" from this sudden odd feeling.

I feel like I need help,"I was diagnosed with depression in 2021 but was also diagnosed before then from a community college counselor. But I started seeing a therapist regularly in 2021. In summer of last year I had to stop because of finances and insurance. My counselor agreed I was seemingly doing better and we ended sessions in June of last year. Also was weened off of the antidepressants I was taking. By the end of October I could feel it making a return. I was upset about work, it was just stressing me out more than I think it should. By December I was ready to find something new I just wanted out. February I got a job interview and offer for a custodial position at a local High School. Seeing that the pay and insurance was much better I accepted not think of what I would be giving up. Because in November my wife and I found out we are expecting our first child. So in accepting this new position I would be giving up FMLA. I was not thinking about it, all I saw was a chance to get out of a job I didn’t care for anymore for more money and better insurance. I started this new job not realizing I wouldn’t have the job assurance I would have had at my previous employer when our baby arrives. She is due at the end of summer break just before school starts again. I’m really scared and beating myself up because I’m pretty sure I made a bad choice. I should’ve just stayed at my previous employer until after the baby got here then I could’ve looked for a new job while I was on leave. I’m scared because I’m on a one year probation and they can just tell me not to come back after summer. Because I will need time after the baby gets here. But something is also telling me it’s ok because I don’t actually think I want to do this after all either. I don’t know what to think. I’ve been waking up so sad and not wanting to come here to just go back to my old job.

i feel so lost,"TW: Self-H\*rm

I don't know why but I feel really lost in my life right now I'm 100% sure if its just my anxiety or me. 

Ever since I was a kid I was a little shy, and my parents knew but always dismissed it as something that'll go away with time. When I started going into gr6, in a new a school, I completely lost the ability to make friends. I was there for 2 years before moving to another school in another country only to once again feel isolated for another 2 years. What made things worse is that most kids in my schools never struggled this much, I was always the loner, the one person by themselves all the time. Now here comes the confusing part; if someone approached me I did feel a little uncomfortable at first, but it quickly goes away it is not visible whatsoever. Whenever I research about anxiety, it talks about a persistent and visible discomfort around people. But thats not the situation with me. I can talk, I can laugh, and I can enjoy being around the person. Yet, till this day, I still have no one that I can actually call a friend. I moved back home to a different school, a boarding school actually. This was suppose to be a huge adjustment but it honestly didn't feel all that different. I was seperated from my family for about 2 years and a half, and it felt really nice to come home, but it wasn't like boarding school was any different then the past 2 years I spent in a different country. I felt alot better here though, I felt more confident, happy and thought maybe I could fix my struggling grades too. I started gr11 there and it was an extremely social place, just like I thought I could blend in with them, become like them if I tried hard enough.

 Fastforward to now, I'm in gr12 and that did not happen. I amassed a lot issues, the biggest one being my health. Being at a boarding school, eating breakfeast/lunch/dinner is a social event now, and I started to develop too much hatred for being there. I skipped dinners,lunchs and breakfeast for days and was just barely surviving on snacks my family left. My parents found out I wasn't eating and wanted to help, but they didnt know how. I talked with guidance counselors, teachers, and lunch staff to help make a plan for me to eat. It lasted for the rest of my gr11 year. I think they thought I got better and didnt need it for my next/last year of hs there. The truth is I didn't eat, regardless of the plan and my weight and health were deteriorating really fast. My family pretty much gave up but still cared about me, and wanted me to eat as much I could at home. I was rarely home because of moms difficult job schedule, and just my family having their own issues was enough for them to feel overwhelmed. 

I felt like I was becoming a burden and my mental health was starting to get worse. I was starting to get casual suicidal thoughts, and thought about hurting myself. I went on twitter and other discussion places about people that do hurt themselves, and it was starting to get really dangerous. The school year ended, thankfully, and I was able to go home and recover. Now, I'm in the middle of my last year of high school, I still struggle with eating, but its definitely in a much better place then before. But I'm thinking more and more about all the things I've missed out on. My hs experience was suppose to be the best time in my life, the most fun I'd have before harsh realities and responsibilities would kick in. But I've never got friends and I never got to experience doing all those crazy teen things. I never really used social media, but I started to sorta stalk ppl in my school and see how their lives were so different then mine. I started comparing myself to them and I was starting to get back to the place I was last year. 

December break started, and I got reunited with family so I once again was able to escape it. 

University applications started and it was pretty scary that I wouldn't get in bcuz of my terrible math grades, but I was able to pull it together and get 1 offer from a pretty good school. At that moment, I didn't realize how that'd affect me, because the following weeks after that I completely lost any motivation do anything, including eating. I started missing out in assignments and rarely studied. My grades dropped, and now I'm close to losing the offer. I still have no motivation to do any assignments, when before it felt mandatory. I feel completely trapped, and I started to not even want to go home on weekend that I could. I'd rather stay and starve, and not study for tests I had on the following weekend. I never got out of my room and my roommate was getting concerned. 

March break came up, and my parents wanted to me study so that I could fix my grades. They felt bad but also wanted to support me by being more strict in my academics. I went to the doctors, was evaluated, and started taking medication to help with my anxiety and my mood. School started again, and I returned to feeling completely unmotivated and starving myself. I can't seem to bring myself out again, and it feels like a giant endless loop. 

Sorry for the long rant, but right now I feel like giant mess, and I'm not sure what to do anymore.",frstybyte,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12bn8bp/i_feel_so_lost/
"Thinking of getting on my car, driving all across Europe, and then picking a new place to live.","But I'm just not fully confident in my mental faculties such that it'll be an enjoyable endeavor.

As if I wasn't terribly depressed, I get all too easily anxious as well; especially in regards to the prerequisite social interaction that such a trip will have to entail to be worth it.

I have actually once picked up my bike and fully traveled all across my country, but ended up shamefully paying for the way back once it began to rain, and what I once thought was a water-proof tent, was actually not, and it also coincided with my low spirits and the realization that I really wasn't enjoying myself all that much through the journey alone — and this was in my country, where I'd still randomly chat with people at ease; I cannot expect the same all across Europe.

As such, I'm rather wary if this won't be a mistake. In a way, it's also running away from a lot of unresolved matters(though I, for the life of me, *cannot* resolve), so I'm also wary they may come to haunt me, wherever I go.

No Real Feasible Continuation,"I hope the morning at least finds you somewhat well, however tall of an order that may be these days.

Thinking about using BetterHelp,"TL;DR: I’ve decided to switch therapists and am wondering how well the BetterHelp system really works and what experiences people have had with that.

-

This started out with a brief explanation as to why I’ve decided to switch but then I realized I needed to talk it through somewhere since I don’t really have anywhere else to vent. Feel free to skip to the end.

I’ve (32f) been talking to my current therapist for about five years now. He’s really great and there are many sessions where I get exactly what I need from them. There has always been a slight awkwardness between us though. I myself can be awkward especially around certain people. Don’t ask me what it is exactly; I don’t know what qualifications my subconscious looks out for since most people I’ve felt particularly awkward around seem perfectly fine. But I digress.

Since the beginning of the pandemic, we switched from in person sessions to phone appointments which is fine but there have been multiple times he’s forgotten or wasn’t able to call me for whatever reason. He’s a bit older so I think it has something to do with that but it can be a bit frustrating. But then I started having a harder and harder time finding things to say. Along with depression and anxiety, I have processing issues, panic attacks, suicidal ideation (and had a few “almost” attempts in the past), have self harmed, have endometriosis, and now fibromyalgia (symptoms presented 2 years ago, and diagnosed last year). There are also some things going on within my family life including my mom being diagnosed with lung cancer last year (doing very well on her medication, btw, but dealing with side effects). I know that sounds like it’s a lot to talk about, but what happens is that after the initial shock, it’s the same old, same old. Or at least, that’s how it feels when I talk to him sometimes. I’ll bring up something I’m struggling with and he’ll basically say, “yeah, that makes sense. You’ve been dealing with that for a while” or something like that and move on. He usually goes into different stories to cheer me up and he’s a big believer in positive thinking and positive energy, so I get why he’s doing it. I just don’t feel like I’m getting to the root of the problem a lot of the time partly because we don’t talk about it at times, and partly because there have also been times when I’ve decided in the moment not to even bring it up. I will say that if it’s more specific such as dealing with a difficult situation with a coworker or an issue I’m having at home, he’s really great at talking me through that.

I think what really got me thinking more about switching though were the comments he’s made recently. I was talking about the fibromyalgia pain I had been dealing with and the length of time it’s now taking me to recover physically from things and he said, “Well, you are getting older.” Then, this past week he said something about the “general wear and tear” my body’s gone through. It just felt invalidating. I’ve been having a really hard time with entering into my 30s and have only just now felt better about that. And it’s not even about aging necessarily. I just haven’t accomplished the things I really hoped I would by this point and it’s getting harder and harder to do so. All of which I’ve explained and talked about with him. And while I am getting older, I’m pretty sure the average 32 year old isn’t experiencing the type of pain I’m going through. Which, again, I have talked to him about over the course of the past two years.

So, yeah. Sorry about the word vomit. I just now realize that it’s time to move on and am wondering what experiences people have had with BetterHelp.",SarahEL17,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12bmrng/thinking_about_using_betterhelp/
My problems don’t compare to everyone’s here but here goes,"I’m in college and about to fail. I’ve spent so much time procrastinating and playing video games. I have the privilege of living with my parents and they believe I’m doing well in school, that’s why they’re fine with me taking a break from working while in school (this semester is my first without a job). I feel like a leech, a parasite. I feel really upset with myself and with the habits I’ve built over the years.

You will be able to read again when you get better,"And yes, you will get better... you are not that 1% special person that is un-healable.

I used to be severly depressive for years, with relapses and all that stuff.

Books are everything to me, and because of my depression, I wasn't able to read anymore. I lost this hobby like I lost my other hobbies like playing guitar or going on long walks.

It was like when a dancer gets tied to a wheelchair.  


I did and do a long therapy that got me out of the worst. And when I have a time where I am not stressed out because of work or exhausted, I can read books as quickly as I used to.

In the beginning I had to force myself to do it, but now I get this flow again when I am reading books, and got myself new books for my shelf.

Depression is hard when everything is useless.,"Hi, greetings!! So my question is, if the human race will eventually end, or the universe will end somehow, why would I care to do important things such as improving my life? Isn't it sad a human being not aknowledging that his existence is useless? I feel like a robot 24/7 and it's probably depression caused by pills that I have took and injections because of my psychosis. Should one live in terms with the present and not think about doing anything rather than be present, or should one think about the future as if one want's something more than improving one's life like improving other's people lifes? For me it doesn't make sense living in the present moment when everything feels sh\*\*. But it doesn't either make sense to do things based on that the future will be better, since it has no meaning. Is this depression? It's nonsense for me anything, and I think it's because I have depression, cause I already lived with hope for a lot of things, but now I just feel like a robot that understands the world, but I can't somehow understand my existence. If I wouldn't have depression I wouldn't even come up with an excuse for not doing stuff, I would just do it. Should I talk with my doctor about my depression? I am not taking any pills.  What I am afraid of is getting symptoms related to my underlying problem if I take any pills for that matter or even worse, getting symptoms of other illnesses, as it already happened when I took Sertraline. Hope I can see any opinion about these thoughts that aflige my mind 24/7 and how one can cope with depression.",cashcashmoney1,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12bmdmj/depression_is_hard_when_everything_is_useless/

Tired to a point I just keep silent. I don't fight for anything anymore. Sleepy all day. Overwhelmed by little things.,"I tried to fight for people attention even when they should be the ones to reach out to me, I comforted and listened to people problems when I needed someone to listen to mine. I feel tired of skin picking that I have along with depression and anxiety. Every day I have little things to do, even getting up just to clean the house, cook or do grocery shopping is extremely overwhelming and I force myself to do it. I try to shower and wash my hair everyday because I feel like I never know if the next day I will be able to get up. Before I felt the need to reach out to people to keep their interest in me but now I don't care anymore. Feels like I'm fighting not only myself but I feel like I'm fighting for everyone else. I don't really scroll through my phone or anything like that. I just play some ASMR and lay down sleeping. I don't even feel guilty for being,,lazy"" . If it was possible I would like to sleep 3/4 of the day and get up only for a very little amount of time to be useful in ways I described doing them like a robot. I just wanna exist and not be bothered because by sleeping most of the day I'm not bothering anyone. I don't have strength or any willing to argue with people who tell me to do something with my life and to explain myself. I don't want to live in the first place and I am supposed to somehow try in it.

I have to get this off my chest,"I have recently made my own reddit account for purposes of making this post because...I honestly feel really horrible right now and I need to get everything off my chest. I have been feeling very depressed for the past month now and now it has gotten to the point where I have scratched myself with scissors just a couple of hours ago. Tbh, I don't know if people are going to emphasize with me because I know a bunch of people on this subreddit go through much worse than me and I'm kinda just expecting that people reading this will think I'm making a big deal out of nothing, but either way, might as well talk about how I feel so I can feel better at least a little bit.

For the past couple of years, my self esteem has been deteriorating and I honestly feel like I'm an absolute nobody. Ever since 2nd grade, I have been bullied and it took a toll on my mental health. I have had people make rude remarks about the way my body looks, about the stuff I was into, and what I believed in. I have been excluded because of my race, (I'm not joking, there was a time when I was playing volleyball with this Hispanic girl who I will call Ruby and then these two black girls indirectly kicked me out of the game and I asked why they weren't including me and one of them said ""We ain't playing with you cuz you're white!"".), I've had an entire art class in 8th grade ridicule and make fun of me because of the fact that I was a nerd and had slightly different political beliefs from the rest of them. I also had this one kid in 5th grade who beat me up on the playground and another kid in 7th grade who made fun of my looks and when I tried to confront him about it, he punched me in the arm. I've also had a death threat made towards me that same year by a different kid who said he was going to take a gun to my face. Yeah. That did not go well. Then in 9th grade, the guy that I liked for many years (who I will call Tom in this post), we started dating and I even had my first kiss with him on Halloween night. But during our relationship, he started touching me in places I did not want to be touched (mainly my breasts, stomach, and another place I don't want to say the name of). At first I was pretty uncomfortable with it and felt like saying something, but since that was my first relationship, I thought it was normal for partners to touch each other whenever so I just let him do whatever he wanted to me. Eventually he broke up with me and I felt really upset about it because he was the only boy that has ever said that he liked me so I felt so depressed and alone and felt like no other boy would love me like that again since I thought all the other boys thought I was ugly. For a whole solid month, I did not stop crying because I was very upset about everything. But after finally getting Sex Ed later during the year and having time to reflect about the situation, I finally came to the conclusion that Tom was using me. He didn't ask for my consent at all when he was touching me so he  low key sexually assaulted me. What's scary was that he was able to get away with it, and what's even more scary is that he had been my friend for several years prior to us dating and he had defended for me against my bullies. 

I am now a junior in high school. Things have changed since the last event I had described. I now have a small new group of friends, I'm currently enrolled in 3 AP classes, and I am slowly turning into a goth/metalhead. I'm not bullied as often as I used to be but I still get bullied and I don't like it one bit. Even though it's been a while since the events I had described has happened, I have been becoming more depressed. I haven't been clinically diagnosed with depression but I feel so miserable all the time now that it's hard to think that I don't have it. I constantly feel as if I'm being watched by everyone else and that they're constantly judging me. I mean, nobody really talks to me besides me friends so it seems like they're avoiding me or something. I have a bad self image about the way my body looks because I feel fat and feel like I have a bunch of acne on my face. I have also been not wanting to participate in much social interaction either which makes it harder for me to make any friends. This semester for me has been incredibly stressful. Not only do I have the same problems as listed above, I also struggle with being an absolute perfectionist about my grades. Since I don't really have very many friends and feel as if every other aspect about me is bad, getting good grades is one of the only things I have left that give me some sort of self worth. Getting good grades has never been too hard for me considering many claim that I am a smart person, but for some reason now, even a B feels like a failure. And now, I have stacks and stacks of work I need to complete so I don't get much sleep nowadays. Typical hours of sleep I usually get is 4 hours. The work load has obviously taken a toll on my mental health because these past couple of months have been the absolute worse for me combined with all the other issues I have. I also have dreams of one day being able to become a famous author considering I like to write stories and poems while also becoming a computer programmer (possibly). The problem is is that right now, I'm one of the slowest coders in my class and I feel as if all my story and poem ideas are bad which makes me feel as if I will never amount to anything in life. I also struggle to do simple day to day tasks as well and whenever my parents teach me how to do something, we end up fighting about it because I end up giving them attitude because their criticism makes me think about the times I have been bullied (note: they are not bad parents. It's my fault I can't take their criticism). I have tried to make myself feeling better by listening to music, watching movies, hell, even creating my own poems to release my energy, but I end up feeling depressed again at some point later on. And what's even worse is that I had a person (an ex friend that used to be part of my friend group) tell me that I had no right to be this upset because the stuff I had gone through is not that bad as others experiences. I know, but it's what I have experienced and I can't change the way I feel about it. I just overall feel like a crappy, pathetic nobody that people will just forget about and if I die, nobody would care. I have tried getting a little bit of help from my friends, my parents, and even my therapist, but I still feel shitty. Things have been getting a bit worse for me as now, I cry and get upset for literally no reason and just today, like I said at the beginning of the post, I have scratched myself with scissors. I honestly don't know if y'all will even feel sorry for me, but no matter the outcome, it just feels good to get all of this off my chest. If you have any advice, feel free to share it with me because I honestly don't know what to do anymore.

Feeling bored with life,"M27, been having a lot of issues recently feeling dissatisfied with life. I feel restless doing things I normally like to do. Playing video games just feels empty, like it's just a distraction while I wait to die.

I've kind of accomplished all the baseline accomplishments. I'm married, graduated college, have a decent job, bought a house. I don't want kids at all, I'm firm on that position. But after doing all that by the time I was 25 I'm looking at everything around me and thinking ""Well I guess I have a whole lot more of this for the next 30 to 50 years.""

I think for most people this would be what motivates them to do something crazy. Learn a new language, studying coding, learn to make music, move to a new country, take up van life or some bullshit. All of these things I have neither the time, intelligence, and/or money to accomplish.

I thought about finding a religion, maybe applying some esoteric meaning to my life but nothing really fits quite right for me. I just don't know what to do anymore, it's like my life is a loop of wake up, go to work, wash dishes, watch TV with my wife, play video games, go to bed.

I Need a Mentor to Help Me Live,"I don't want to sound desperate, but I think this might be the only thing that saves me - not that I want to take my life, but I feel like I've already lost it. 

I have been living with my elderly parents (who live in separate homes) for several years. I'm unemployed because I have many serious mental health troubles, including social phobia, treatment resistant depression, and maladaptive daydreaming (yes, I know it's not an official diagnosis, but I have an intense form of the disorder). I have coped with extreme isolation with using fantasy and daydreaming. 

My life fell to pieces in 2018 when I suddenly quit my case manager job. I didn't leave my apartment for six months because of fear and a mix of terrible emotions and depression. I have never had full functioning like most adults - just the bare minimum job and a place to live. 

I cannot socialize. I have no money. I am so anxious so often, most days I do not leave my bed. I am seeing a therapist, but 30 minutes a week is not really enough to get me anywhere. I had severe emotional neglect growing up, and no one taught me how to manage the most basic of things. 

I have tried many, many solutions over the years. I have sought out many kinds of treatments. Nothing has really budged me, or given me a thirst to live life. I have tried. But I have never made a friend, or developed a healthy foundation of trust with another human being. 

I'm looking for a service that can help me out. Maybe a volunteer thing, I don't know. I need a mentor, someone who is willing to work closely with me, keep me on track with small goals, and actually care about me. I just need some healthy mirroring and a feeling of connection.

How it started an how it's going.,"I'm Lilith (17/f). It all started when I was two and a half years old. My mom found me in a closet after she left me alone with my dad for a day. I was naked, crying and had wet myself. He was always violent to my mother. He hit her, locked her in a room and things like that. When I turned four my mom finally broke up with him. Things didn't get better though. He tried to sue for custody many times, for like six or seven years. I never wanted to see him. I really fought with wetting myself. The things he did weren't the only things that made me like I am today. In Elementary school the two sons of a friend from my mother started touching me. I didn't know what they were doing was wrong but they said they would tell my mom if I didn't let them do what they want. One was like a year older then me, the other a year younger. They were allowed everything at home. They watched Horror movies and adult movies. Their parents didn't care, they were mostly smoking weed in the living room. They touched me very often and even wanted me to touch them. One time my new step-dad came home and found me with the boys in their hiding spot. They wanted me to put  We never really talked about it. Just that I shouldn't be doing stuff like that. Then the older one started bullying me on the way to school and on the way back. He hit me and held a lighter really close to my face. Sometimes pretending he put a firecracker in my jacket. One time I fell on my face because he tripped me up. In school he told everyone I tried to hit him and that's why he did that. Then Finally after 4th grade I switched schools. I finally didn't have to see then anymore. At the new school things got a little better but nobody really wanted to be friends with me. They all ignored me. Except for like 3 people. We hung out a lot but just in school. I stayed for the 5th grade then changed schools again. I had my first boyfriend. I met a really cool guy in class I became friends with. He had depression and was trans, we got along very well. My boyfriend didn't want me to have friends. So he isolated me from the others. It got so bad that the teachers told him to stay away from me. When I was alone with him like at my place or his, he just wanted to make out. He kissed me and touched me. I didn't feel very loved after awhile. One time he wanted to look at and touch my ass. So I laid on the bed on my stomach. He touched me and after like two minutes I looked back at him and he wasn't just touching he was taking pictures. After that I didn't want him to touch me. He became 
distant and I started cutting myself because I felt unwanted, unloved. He didn't care. He told my mom one time when I asked if it bothers him if I kissed him while I was sick. He said I don't care about you cutting yourself but don't kiss me when you're sick. My mom freaked out. She started looking for a Therapist for me. My boyfriend broke up with me shortly after. 
In 8th grade I repeated a school year. I met a lot of awesome people in the new class.
Many of them had the same interests as me so I found friends very quickly. But many thought I was weird because I didn't talk alot. I still don't talk much but it got better. In 9th grade I went to a mental hospital. Things got better again. I didn't finish school though. My grades where kinda bad so I went to professional school. But I didn't go there alone. One of my friend also went there and we got into the same class. At first I was the weird kid but my friend covered me with his weirdness. I got along well with one girl and still do. The moment I entered the class I fell in love with two guys. One looked like an emo so just my type but the other one had medium long curly hair and pretty blue eyes. I didn't thing the blue eyed boy would ever like me so I went for the emo. My relationship with him was just the same as my last one. While I was with him I thankfully became friends with the blue eyed boy. I told him that the emo wasn't very nice to me and that he probably cheated on me and that I cut myself because of that. He started worrying about me and we hung out a lot playing Wii together. Even drinking bailey's together. Getting closer and closer. He got very disappointed because I couldn't break up with the emo. One time he got so frustrated that he punched his punching bag till he started bleeding. He started drinking and sat in front of my house with a friend. He called me and told me many times that he loves me. Two days after I broke up with the emo. I started hanging out more with the blue eyed boy and we started dating since then things really got better. I'm really thankful that I met him we're together for almost half a year and I'm really happy with him. I think things are going to be much better from now on.

I lost everything three years ago. I'm out of hope that things will ever get better.,"Three years ago, I had a sudden medical event that almost killed me. Statistically, at my age and physical condition, I was more likely to get hit by lightning. I was rushed to the hospital, where I stayed for days by myself because no visitors were allowed due to COVID.

Two days after I got home, my wife asked for a divorce.

I had a slow physical recovery. Then I had to move out of the house we had bought together. I remember that winter, living under lockdown, totally isolated. I wanted to die.

I took steps to improve my life. I was unhappy at my job so I moved to a new city, got a master's degree. But it's all been for nothing.

I'm nearing 40 and I'm still single. I desperately want to be a dad, but the chances of that happening are getting worse every day. I've tried dating and it's gone horribly. After I got my master's, I ended up with basically the same job I used to have. I have zero satisfaction from my work and the pay is shit, especially in a high cost of living city. I have to take all sorts of medication because of my health, which have some super fun side effects, like impotence. I'm stuck in a body that is working against me.

I'm in therapy, I'm on antidepressants and nothing works. I feel completely hopeless that my life will get better. I've only seen it get worse over the past few years. I can't quit my job because my work visa relies on it. I'm all alone in this city - it was my birthday this weekend and I spent it by myself. A few friends called, but I can't tell them any of this. They all have spouses and kids. They have enough to worry about. My parents love me but I feel like I'm just a drag on them, just something for them to worry about. My siblings give them joy - they're accomplished people, with beautiful children. I'm just a void that takes and can never give back. 

It seems everything I touch turns to shit. Even when I had pets a few years ago, both my cats got extremely sick and I had to put them to sleep.

I'm convinced I was supposed to die three years ago. Surviving disrupted the natural order and that's why my life sucks. I'm taking up space I'm not supposed to be in. I'm not supposed to be here.

Last night I couldn't sleep. I got out of bed, took a Xanax and then tied a belt around a doorknob and pulled it around my neck just to see if it would work but even leaning forward with all my body weight I could still breathe. If I could find a painless way to go, I'd take it.

Dealing with Anxiety and Intrusive Thoughts," 

Today, I'm a really difficult day dealing with anxiety and suicidal thoughts. I felt overwhelmed and hopeless, and I didn't know how to cope. Don't get me wrong please, I do not plan on doing anything stupid because I have much to live for, I think I just wanted to share my feelings with someone, because I feel the people around wouldn't understand me.

Now, I did not feel anxious or anything like that, but I was at the gym, doing some cardio and I started to have really negative feelings. I went out of the gym and I continued to have them. The last time this happened to me, was 4 years ago when my anxiety was at it's peak. Thoughts of being worthless, depression and suicidal and I hate myself for having them.

I guess what I wanted to share my feelings and I wanted to ask to those who suffer from anxiety, if once in a while this is something you also feel, and how do you cope with them.

my (21f) best friend and (19mboyfriend both left me 3 days apart.,"i need help. id like to start this off by saying i (19f) have diagnosed clinical depression that is always worse in the colder months. 9 months ago, i moved half way across the country to move in with my now ex, i think i was trying to escape my problems at home, but it didnt work. i tried school and work but both caused me so much pain that i inevitably quit school and work, out of concern for my mental health. a few months ago, i realized i was much worse then i thought. what i thought was just average laziness turned into sobbing in the bathroom with the shower on at 4 am so my boyfriend wouldnt know. i wasnt particularly sad about anything, i just feel a sense of chronic loneliness and hatred for the world. i ended up moving home a month ago today. 3 days ago, my boyfriend and i broke up. 2 years down the drain and all i got from it was 2,000 miles on my car from the drive to live with him. knowing my boyfriend and i broke up, my best friend decided to call it quits. she greatly upset me a few days ago, and when i tried to explain how her actions made me feel, she decided she wanted nothing to do with me. she actually called me a ""cunt sandwich"" what does that even mean???

im not particularly sad over these losses. but now i feel as if i have no one. i moved home because i was struggling with my mental health and thought i had this great support system waiting for me. but since moving home everything and everyone has pulled me down even more. i feel as if i will never be able to dig out of this hole that i didnt even throw myself into. i dont even know what happened between ex and i and ex bestie and i. all i know is, i wasted a sh*t ton of time on them and for what? 

i just got out of a 48hour hold in the psych ward because my mom was scared i was going to commit and had me admitted. im actually way to scared of death to do anything about it, but i do cry for days and days at a time. im so
tired. and not in the sense of sleep. im tired of not being enough, being annoying. being loud when im having a good time, im tired of not being skinny enough. i have done everything for everyone, but nobody ever does anything for me. i just wanna feel love and support.",purpleturtle385,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12bhc19/my_21f_best_friend_and_19mboyfriend_both_left_me/
I gave my best friend a small window into my mind while I was spiralling,"I'd call my depression functional. As functional as it gets I guess. 

I told him things were getting dark and I ended up writing about it. What came out was something like a message from my depression and it was mean.

He laughed, which is fine we laugh about this stuff all the time, he has depression too. He said ""oh you're just really telling yourself to die"" and I'm like no, lol no! That's the nice part of it! Death is the comfort. I started telling myself in the journal entry the I'm doomed to misery because of my anxious attachments and how I'll just take on a charity case because of a litany of toxic behaviors I have. How I'm a magnet for misery, so that's all I have for any of my loved ones. None of which is true (I think) because I just love my friends and we all have problems(I'm still convincing myself I think)

He took a sobering pause. ""Oh ok, you're right. That is a lot"" because I think he was just realizing that was the tip of the iceberg and it was just more than he expected me to say.

I don't know if the affirmation was appreciated or not because it's actually painful. I don't know anyone outside of my own mind that would say such mean things about some of the only things that make me happy in life(still sounds horribly selfish, actively trying not to shut down and everyone out for my own bullshit) 

On one hand, yes! You see me a tiny bit, I'm awful. I'm awful for *myself*  and my best intentions will always be weaponized against me. On the other hand, what does that even do for me? Oh he saw me drowning in my own tears, oh woe is me. How fucking productive, belittling yourself and your relationships because you feel bad, poor baby.

I'm a firm believer that willpower is the biggest asset against my own depression. There's a hormonal imbalance then I get ""comfortable"" feeling awful and breaking that habit is nearly impossible. I've definitely had year or more long cycles before. What help did this conversation do for me? I just keep looking for light in the dark and it's early in this cycle so I'm panicking, I don't want to fucking be here. I don't want to go back in. It's too early to say ""oh this will pass like they all do"" because I don't even know how long I'll be here, god I just don't want to be back. 

I guess this ended up being a vent. I was just taken aback by our conversation because I don't think I've ever talked about how my depression turns my view of myself into this evil, conniving, manipulative person who actually doesn't give a shit about anyone she loves, she just wants to control her little dolls and make them dance for her. It doesn't sound like me but it's so hard to say that *isn't me*.",SadAndNasty,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12bh9tu/i_gave_my_best_friend_a_small_window_into_my_mind/
feel like shit,"im probably at the lowest period of my life when im at the most important year of my life (final year of hs).

i feel like i got no real value, connection or friends in this world. I sure hang out with a group of friends, and sometimes they are nice but in reality i am always the odd one out. 

The reasons not to like me irl are totally justified because I was/am weird at times, but society will applaud others for it but others will just hate you for it. 

Academically im losing it as well, but i believe i can come back if i battle with my procrastination appropriately.

I just have no one to talk to irl, my issues are embarrasing. I just have no friends, no one i can trust, no one i can talk to, no one that loves me. 

Is it because of how I look and act? Or was the world just always against me from the first day.

I'm lost in life,"It's a long post, mostly complaints with no real content. I just need a place to talk.

I'm stuck in a major I really don't enjoy. I was forced into here by my family. I kept failing but they still refused to let me transfer or drop out. I failed again a couple days ago and suddenly realised I'm not afraid of anything anymore. But at the same time I lost my motivation in life. I received a letter from the college pretty much saying I'm gonna be kicked out. And I am now like ok so what.

Soon I'll be 25+ with no job experience and no degree. My family is completely disappointed at me at this point knowing the letter. They finally accepted that I'm not high achieving I'm just some random loser. I'm too trash to live up to their plans. They are angrily sad and said it was all my fault. I ruined my own life and they are done.

Surprisingly, at this point I really don't feel sorry or bad about how my family thinks of me. Thay can be mad and sad all they want. Just like how I've been feeling all these year. It's like a little revenge from me really. I'm 100% willing to throw my life just to prove them wrong. I want them to know if they let me go down the road of my dream I'll just be far better, at least know forcing me to do something I don't like is not going to work out. It's childish but it's me, someone who is pretty much only connected to the world through video games for the past 7 years. But looks like I'm never gonna see the day they regret. They are still blaming everything on me. I used to think if my death is going to get them regret and apologise for stopping me to pursue my dream, I'll jump out of the window no doubt. I'm glad I didn't do that bc I now know they are 100% not going to regret or feel sorry for me whatever I do. They are just going to blame everything on to be and make the conclusion that I have weak mental.

They have their reasons to be like this. I understand and I used to be trapped in this thinking of I should fulfill their expectations bc they gave me life. But after all these years of headache and crying from study, I want to give my life back to myself. I'm sorry but I love myself more.

I wish I can go back to high school everyday. I wanna rewrite my life from the beginning. It was my dream to work in games. But not a single person supports it. That's why I am here studying a degree that gives me a headache every time I look at it. I tried to explain what I really wanted to do to my family and all they ever ask is how much will I earn. I'll never earn as much as going down the path they set for me. But that path is no easy and I know 100% I'm not reaching the end. This is proved now from me getting kicked out by the college.

What they don't and never understand is I don't want an above average salary, I want a life which I wake up without headache and crying. They kept telling me for the past idk how many years, that work and study are meant to be painful. Everyone is the same and people use their off-work to heal. This logic just doesn't correct itself anymore. If work is meant to be a mental disaster and you use all the free times to restore, the money you earn above what you need for basic living has literally no use. Plus I'm not planning to get married or have children, so I won't be using the money to take care of anybody, either. I only want the very basic amount of money to keep myself surviving, I ever only had that much anyway. I want to use the rest of my life doing something I enjoy.

But the sad news is I only realised that I want to enjoy my life when my life is over. This hurts me 100x harder than my family calling me loser.

I have no degree, no money, no support.

I want to start a career in games at the age of 25+ with pretty much no experience.

I know it's impossible. Plus I'm not one of those genius that somehow just magically manages to get things sorted. I only have the bravery to write it down here in reddit. But hey, I want to make it happen. Even if I ended up failing I have proved to myself that I'm not weak. I have the bravery to do something no one supports, which is already pretty amazing.

But I'm quite tired now. I'll have a rest first before I dive deep. It took me a very very long time to realise I can be different to what my family wishes. Thank you for anyone who reads to this end.",somedayillfigureout,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12b7mv4/im_lost_in_life/

Depression following sexual assault.,"I was sexually assaulted by an ex girlfriend ages ago. Recently the trauma has resurfaced and I’ve been very depressed since.

I feel like all my value as a man is tainted, and destroyed. I’ll never be the same, and I’ll never get the person who I was before back. I’m forever doomed to live a life of denial, and shame. I have no right to call myself a “victim.”

Nobody will believe me. I’m the walking punchline of jokes. I’m seen as weak by society now. I feel disgusting. My own gosh betrayed me.

My life nowadays is just reliving that experience every single day. It’s all I think about. It’s like a video constantly replaying in my head. 

I am still in denial I was even assaulted. I don’t want to accept it, or believe it. I never thought it would happen to me.

College admissions isn’t making it easier for me to not kill myself.,"I will update.

I’ve already gotten four rejections.

This next admission decision that I’m opening up is the coin flip that will determine my life, as this school is my last foundation for living.

I remember telling my friends that if I got into some other college I really liked (not the same as the one I’m talking about now), I would brag about it. But I was rejected from there and I never brought it up again.

Complete academic and occupational success is one of my last and strongest reasons to keep living. If I could not even be successful or exceptional in those areas in my desired ways, I would most likely be in a hospital or ward right now. Exceptionality, especially in academics and capabilities, is possibly the biggest reason for me to be alive.

I gave up on my dreams to be some big-name astronomer, so now I want to achieve my second-biggest career goal: Be a Senior IT Director or something like that.  I don’t know if that’s possible for me, but I think I’m good at computer science. I kind of like computer science because I don’t find it hard. But even then, this goal of being an impressive computer science director is my last reason to live. And this school I’m talking about is the last one that I would say is the perfect place to achieve this goal.

Basically, this school has my will to live in its hands.

If I am accepted into this school, I will avoid any suicide attempts in the next few years, and I’ll try to enjoy my life.

If I am not accepted, I will die in the next six years or less.

We’ll see.






HILARIOUS UPDATE: I got rejected! Again! :)

I’m really done. 

My mom was right about me. She told me that I was going to sit and watch as my peers go on to do great things and I would just stay quiet as I have nothing to show for myself. 

I’m sitting alone with a rejection letter on my computer. of tears are falling. Lots of them. 

The staff at my school told me that everyone will end up going to the places they deserve to be in.
I was told to be realistic about my expectations, so I believe I was delusional for applying to these colleges. I really, REALLY fucked up somewhere in my life that caused me to not achieve the crucial goal of being a high-achieving individual, so now, I’m not able to go to places like a good college anymore.


As a result, I plan to isolate myself. I can’t live with these feelings of loss, shame, regret, despair, and disappointment. And I can’t live with the outcome of these admissions decisions affecting the rest of my life. 

I think I’m going to kill myself in college at the latest now.

I’m lost. What can I do?,"Hello, I have always been a hard worker but recently I’ve been going through ptsd and started getting treatments then I started getting physically ill and had car troubles. I continuously worked on everything and asked for permission to have time off mostly with my own hours. I was always allowed but then one day I came in and I found out I was fired for being unreliable. I didn’t fight it because the people there were lazy, unreasonable, or aggressive. But now I am in a economy that isn’t hiring very much and the ones that are hiring are either denying me or have 30 applicants. I’ve applied to over 300 jobs and I’ve only heard back from 10 with 2-3 interviews. I have never had this issue I have always been a golden star and now my life is falling apart with no access to unemployment. Rent and car payments were missed and I’m now starving. I’m on the verge of loosing my life and I don’t know what to do.

"Every time I reach out, it backfires","I [19F] made an impulsive decision a few days ago which has resulted in a fight between my mother and I. After her continuously calling me a ""selfish bitch,"" I wrote her a letter detailing everything going on and after a few hours she told me she was going to talk to my father in the morning and work something out for me. I was so happy and hopeful. I even experienced an emergency at work and texted my mom for help, and she came and picked me up. I felt like things were going to be better moving forward. 

Later today, I was greeted with a conversation about how being depressed versus happy is a choice and my life is, by all means, wonderful. There is just no possible way, in their minds, I could feel this way. Additionally, I appear extremely happy and I am just a liar if I've been truly feeling depressed this whole time. Growing increasingly antagonistic toward me, my mother kept asking me how she failed me and what she did that was ""so wrong."" 

I was so fucking hopeful something would change this time. Instead, I'm back to feeling like the helpless 12-year-old crying to my mother for help, who will just be let down again.",grumblepaste,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12bao3m/every_time_i_reach_out_it_backfires/
Community College over the past couple if year's has made me feel depressed and uncaring for college education as a whole.,"Ever since the pandemic hit a couple of years back, I have been procrastinating on my college work more and more even when we were allowed to return to in-person classes. After getting annoyed with all the Calculus and Physics in the engineering program at my community college, I decided to change my program to the Simulation and Game Development program, as I've always wanted to find a career where I could unleash my creative imagination in both arts and writing for something entertaining.

Unfortunately, even before or after changing programs, I've been procrastinating on my homework outside of class more and more. Throughout my life, I've always been diagnosed with autism ever since I was little. Yet whether it'd be doing in-person classes or online work, I feel like my interests have been fading away. Over the past couple of semesters, I've been feeling burned out, low on energy, anxious, and obsessed with perfection, constantly doubting myself or thinking that my artwork and models are mundane or not good enough when compared to my peers, and just gained a dislike of doing long, or tedious tasks. 

It's gotten to the point where I've now procrastinated to the point of no longer acting for college education as a whole, as I often feel exhausted, lack sleep, skip breakfast just about every day, and just hardly feel the need, motivation, energy, or interest to work on ANYTHING for my courses. It's like I'd rather just play video games, make YouTube playthroughs, read fanfiction, or watch anime in my free time over doing any important schoolwork I know needs to get done, but keep putting it off more and more, and sometimes even turning in work that could either be better or us just incomplete.

It's like.... just about everything college related feels meaningless to me, and I just feel too attached to my comfort zone.

I feel depressed, stressed, exhausted, and just unmotivated and feel done with hard work, effort, and education as a whole. It's started to make me recently hate myself for being this way, refusing to develop myself, nor properly taking care of myself, such as not brushing my teeth or even getting up or going to bed at reasonable times.

It's almost like I'm just so tired of wasting my time with college that I feel too burned out to actually want to do anything. I enjoy art and writing and want to put it into something I feel like I would enjoy, but nothing about life feels motivating or interesting to me anymore. It feels more than just autism, stress, perfectionism or ADHD. 

Grades, education, getting an Associate's, or just about anything and everything college-related makes me feel depressed. I can't stand not feeling like I want to do almost anything anymore. But if fear that if I drop out or quit, what path would I even have left? Where would I go? What would I do? To me, there would just be no other path to take. I'm scared of what I would do after college or even living on my own. It's like I'm just too scared, unsure, or terrified of growing up, getting a major job, or even going into the outside world. It's like I want to stay connected to my youth forever, cause I know I'll just grow old and die eventually, making me feel like any achievements I do reach would feel meaningless. Thus why I feel too connected to my comfort zone and waste my time slacking off and being lazy instead of working like a proper college student.

I'm even scared of talking to my own parents about my situation, cause I feel like they wouldn't understand or hate me for wasting my time for something they think I'm not interested into.

Add to the world being an overly-competitive place, and me just having self-doubt about my work hardly being as good as those around me, and it's even harder to stay focused.

It's like I can no longer appreciate, motivate, or understand myself as a whole. I don't know what to do, where to go, how to figure out what it is I want in life, and just feel too frightened, pressured, stressed, and exhausted of almost everything around me.

Add to me taking about three or four classes per semester with my part-time job on weekends, and I just feel like I hardly, if ever, have the time not energy to do anything at all. Heck, I can hardly even focus on my own hobbies of making Youtube playthroughs and Let's Plays or even write my own fanfiction stories because of all the stress I'm getting. A lot of people keep saying that I should maintain a daily routine or make a proper schedule, but even if I did that, I doubt it would help, as I fear I would hardly follow or go through with it in the state I'm currently in. And when I take breaks, I always end up slacking off or avoiding my work by wasting more time instead if getting back to it until the last minute rolls around.

I've reached the point where college education feels meaningless, boring, uninteresting, and just not worth it to me anymore and that I'd rather stay close to my comfort zone forever. I'm in a state of depression and I just have no idea how to get out of it after I've grown to feel this way over the last year or two.",Pokemon_Bakugan_Fan,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12bairs/community_college_over_the_past_couple_if_years/

Went back to my final hobby and felt numb after,"Back in 2018 I had a few fights in amateur boxing. I won 2 fights, lost 2 fights but in the end I loved it more than what ever the result of the fight was as it was simply an escape from my own head and the constant lethargy and anhedonia that is my life. Eventually I had some scares with an eye injury and lingering symptoms from a nasty concussion that lead me to stepping away and bowing out of the sport with my vision and cognition still intact.

In the years since 2018 my life has only declined in quality, enjoyment and overall optimism. On a whim I decided to re-join my old gym last month. I sparred with a couple of the young fighters there and had a blast getting back into the rhythm of things. My old coach joked that I should put my shirt back on as I am now 25 pounds heavier than when I last competed and my belly and titties were jiggling all over the ring. For a brief period I felt some respite from the pain of my life and just enjoying the only thing I really ever liked to do.

However as soon as the sparring session was over and we left the gym my mood dropped back to a 1/10 and I just slowly walked home for another night staring at the wall and forcing myself to play some videogames. Back in 2018 having a sparring session or fight could leave me with a natural high for at least 2-3 days. This would help me resist the temptation of turning to alcohol and opiates to lift my mood. 

I now find myself in a conundrum where I can go back doing the only thing I love however every time I participate in it I am just acquiring more brain damage and further damaging my previously injured eye.

how to stop falling into a guilty cycle and make change,"My depression doesn't usually come in the form of suicidal thoughts or such.

failed exam and it was my fault,"I just need to let everything off my chest, maybe it will make me feel better idc if anyone reads this- maybe you'll feel better about your own life.

I am so tired. I'm taking prerequisite classes at a local community college to apply to grad school because I am bad at and hate my job and want something different. I work 12+ hour days (while logging 8) because to be frank, I am the least productive person on my team at work due to just not being as good at everyone else at our job despite trying my best to learn and putting in the time. In order to somewhat catch up with everyone, I have to work 12+ hours and I am constantly worried about being fired (I work in the tech field) especially after my coworker (kindly) told me on the down low that everyone knows that I am slower than everyone else they just don't call me out. I appreciate him for saying so, since I honestly suspected it for awhile since my work is ALWAYS overwritten by someone else before I finish so I feel I am making 0 impact. I am the useless shitty coworker that everyone clowns in memes and now I am afraid to ask questions since no matter how many notes I take, I always seem to struggle with the same things.

After those 60+ hr days working, I am also taking 2 difficult math classes. I can't even sleep anymore. I sleep and I wake up after 3 hours every night and cannot go back to sleep due to the immense stress. Sometimes I cannot sleep at all despite feeling tired constantly. Doesn't matter if I eat magnesium or melatonin- I've tried those. I have daily non-stop killer headaches that make me want to scream and Advil only works half the time now. I have a hard time eating and feel nauseous constantly. Allergy symptoms like itchy eyes and blocked ears that I never had prior. I have acne and dermatitis rashes all over my skin from stress and also the pharmacy has run out of my skin meds for a few months now. It's incredibly embarrassing to go out in public. I haven't done anything ""fun"" since replying to my friends feels so tiring now and I'm way too busy to hang with them and I am afraid I may lose them since ""I'm busy"" only works so many times though its true. The only ""fun"" thing I do is going to the gym twice a week because I think I would go back to self-harming and not taking care of myself if I didn't, but its an uphill battle. I used to play video games, hike, draw but I do none of that now since I quite literally have no time.

This week was midterms week, I had so much anxiety about failing I pushed the exams off until the last day and was studying during all my free time during the week (along with doing the usual weekly homework/quizzes/labs/discussions also due that week) and realized the exams were longer than I thought they were so I only had 10 mins to take a 2 hour exam since I only allotted 3 hrs for all of them when they should have taken 6 hrs total. Obviously, I failed it. STUPIDEST mistake ever. It hurts because I spent so much time working hard for WEEKS (this stuff does NOT come easy to me and I spend a LOT of time studying), and had achieved a near perfect grade (97-99%) on all my homework/quizzes/labs/discussions for my classes before this + the price of paying for the classes out of pocket. So much hard work and time wasted. I am so damn stupid. I am slow compared to everyone else, and I can't even read numbers right.

After reading what /r/professors had to say about students who missed their exams I realized that professors actually don't give a single doggy shit about their students and perhaps even resent them (why teach??) so there's no use trying to explain my problem since it seems they just use our personal issues to laugh behind students backs and feel superior to others while our lives are being ruined (it's not your job to fix our problems, but have some empathy for students realizing they are losing out on their dreams fuck). It is definitely my own fault, and not my professor's but I lost even more faith in living when I realized the people who should want to see students learn and succeed just don't care despite them having the power to turn lives around. Even my team members, boss, and lead at work are more understanding since they know I am always trying my best which according to the professors is not the ""real world.""

It's too late to drop at this point without getting an automatic F (I will JUST barely get a C- if I get a PERFECT score on my final which is unreasonable for a class of this nature). Even if I retake the class, grad schools will just take the average of the two grades so the mark is there forever. I always dreamed of going to a higher mid-tier grad program to do research since I went to a fairly average state school (despite almost failing out of HS due to not knowing what depression was). I almost also failed freshman year until I was assigned an awesome doctor at school by some crazy miracle. The past 2 years in my 4-year college I almost achieved a perfect GPA so I wanted to aim higher this time. With how picky schools are nowadays this just ruined my chances for something so STUPID (I had a strong upward trend that I could explain, not anymore). I also need time to create personal projects to learn or for resumes/applications which I just have not had the time to do so I have nothing else going on my grad school applications.

I hate my job, and now since I failed this class I cannot apply for grad school next round. I was hoping to quit my job before then since my job is requiring RTO full time (in a different state so I have to leave my support system here- great!!!!) by the middle of the year so I will need to figure out how to commute AND go to school. I cannot just quit my job with no plan to upskill/new job- I have school loans to pay and other living expenses and the tech sector is way too competitive right now for someone as shitty at their job as me for the moment. My superstar coworker cannot even get a call back, and he is willing to take a significant pay reduction to not be in the area the company is requiring us to go to- so how can I?

My head is hurting so bad as I write this, and I haven't eaten since the morning I failed my midterm because I can't keep anything down (as someone whose only consistent non-stress inducing activity that's keeping my head above water at this point is weightlifting, this is the worst scenario possible so that's also stressing me out). I still need to act normal at work even though I've been crying and in pain 24/7 which has been hard. Smile, cry, smile, cry. 16 hours everyday of just study and work. The hours spent studying wasted. 8 hours of trying to sleep and taking care of myself which is failing.

I've never felt so depressed in years even though I am trying my hardest not to get back to my lowest point since I can only rely on myself to fix me. I put in so much hard work, sacrificed my mental/physical/social health for just some hope that I can do something that I can feel happy about just to punch myself in the teeth and kick myself in the head every time I try my best, there's no one to blame for my issues except me. I try to remind myself of everyone I am still around for- my family, the few close friends I have, and the doctor that did everything in her power to help me despite being an extremely tough and unreliable patient which was the cornerstone that allowed me to succeed in college.

Maybe I need to find a therapist, but every therapist I've seen made me feel terrible and costed hundreds of dollars (It's well-known that all the good therapists do not take insurance- I can attest to this wholeheartedly) that I cannot afford now since I need to save up for the move. No one wants to hear a woe is me story since everyone has their own problems (super valid btw, I understand- that's what a therapist is for) so I've just been keeping it all to myself and no one the wiser. But it's getting harder and harder to smile and talk in a upbeat manner everyday.

"I am sleeping 12-14 hours and I don’t like it. I don’t have motivation to do anything and I find that if I’m awake, I overthink and am anxious so sleeping at least delays that. Does anyone else feel like their days are just slipping by and there isn’t a point to much?","
I am just living this really mundane life everyday where all days are the same. I don’t like my job and I’m trying to find a new one but I’m probably not putting in as much effort as I should. 

I have dreams but everyday, I focus so much on ruminating on small unimportant shit that I don’t have time or the mental capacity to go after my goals. I feel like I’m wasting my days and everyday that passes, I haven’t done anything productive that will help my future self. I don’t want to wake up and then realize 20 years from now, that I’ve wasted my youth and have nothing to show for it

I’m 27 and I always hear my parents and elders saying to enjoy my youth and how it’s the time of their lives but it makes me depressed that I’m not having fun and my youth is slipping away. I don’t have friends, only work acquaintances. I would love to go out and do normal 20 something year old things but at the same time, going out requires a lot of energy that I probably wouldn’t have half the time

I see people on Instagram who are so adventurous and love to travel and do outdoorsy things like skiing, surfing, camping and road tripping in an rv and I really would like to do those things or at least try them but I have no idea how to do that.

Not normal,"I have issues. Also all i do is spread my negative qualities (all that's left) so when i try to reach out, i feel i only spread this disease and feel worse about it.

You don't understand... I notice everyday the things in my past that have built up to this moment and everything with it. 

I notice my brain saying offensive thing, im afraid I'll imitate that and say something from impulsive and get me hurt by accidentally offending someone. I already feel it's too late for me. I'm so terrified but i don't show it because I've had to deal with this but in smaller amounts which don't last this long.

Every movement that springs from my being is an invitation for someone to hurt me and i have not agreed to this yet i feel this way. I live in constant anxiety and stress. I only had small moments of just feeling ok as if none of this had happened, not even feeling good. 

I know something might be wrong with me, i can't get along with anyone, i hate socializing more than usual, i can't hold a job, i make everyone angry. I also make everyone awkward and like me, which i feel guilty for. 

Maybe I'm just anxious or depressed. So i ignore everything but when i blink i feel all this in a single thought. The worst part is that i might spread my experiences and they'll be stuck with this like a disease like me. 

No medication, no religion. I'm trying everyday to control my thoughts but that's not possible no more. I'm going insane i notice my impulsives are growing strong and my fear only strengthens as i fear that i will make someone mad enough to kill me. I'm really struggling. 

What's worse is i spread all this to my family members which are innocent. I feel like crying in the middle of a store because I feel so helpless and hopeless, i just don't want any of this anymore. I feel like i have a invisible layer upon me which, for when a dangerous person is around me, and with my impulsive idiotic nature due to my ""disease"" they both mix into my inevitable and painful demise. 

Trust me when I say I'm not doing fine 😭

I genuinely don't know what's wrong with me and i apologize because of who i am. I'm just looking for a solution. I just don't feel right. I feel like i deserve death or something i don't know what's wrong with me

Brain chemistry,"I was really depressed six months ago, to the point where I began having regular panic attacks and felt like bugs were crawling all over my body.

If you haven't experienced depression, it's very difficult to understand. In my experience, it's a matter of brain chemistry, because brain chemistry regulates everything. If your brain chemistry is good, you can float aimlessly towards your inevitable death in space. If your brain chemistry is bad, you can suffer greatly despite being surrounded by all your loved ones and riches.

When I was depressed, almost nothing brought me joy. There were no encouraging words that could help me. There was no advice that I found helpful. Nothing convinced me, and I know that almost nothing will convince you either.

Fortunately, for me, medication helped. I didn't need encouraging words, I didn't need advice. They were completely useless. I just needed my brain chemistry to be in order. Everything resolved itself when I started feeling good again. Now I feel so good that I could die content today.

A depressed person has one big reward ahead of them: when they are no longer depressed. The feeling of waking up one morning and feeling great after all the darkness and despair is something magical.

I struggled and struggled until the medication started to work. I wanted to die and hoped that lightning would strike me. But I wasn't capable of killing myself, and luckily I didn't.

Although I can't give advice or encouraging words, I know that you are going through a struggle. That struggle is the greatest in your life. You go through the same emotions as many World War II soldiers did in their hopelessness and senselessness. You contemplate the meaninglessness of life like thousands of others. You seek help from motivating advice, philosophical texts, alcohol or drugs. They are your ammunition.

However, know that there is a solution. To paraphrase Chomsky, hope in itself is more than no hope at all. Without hope, you sign your fate.

"I made a huge mistake and am completely off track with my medication, need advice","TL;DR at the end.

Disclaimer: I have an appointment tomorrow with a professional to discuss this. Just looking for practical advice from those more experienced with this stuff.

  I (32F) am new to having mental health struggles. After having an unexpected third child right after the second, with MAJOR health problems (two surgeries + 96 days in NICU, in 2020, to boot), all the pandemic stuff, the general stress of three little kids, and my dad's recent death, I gradually went from reasonably stressed under the circumstances to having occasional irrational panic attacks (""Omg maybe I'm a horrible person and my family hates me"") and serious moments of depression (""I have no purpose and can never be happy with my life. I will never be happy again.""). Prior to this, I was a very happy person.

I went to the doctor and got put on escitalopram. After about three weeks, it was like my life was fixed. I loved everything in my life again, like I used to. I was so excited. Even the side effects I'd heard of were the opposite (easier time dieting, more energy for exercise, higher sex drive, etc).

 But then, as someone not used to taking medication, I made a huge mistake. For my genetic insomnia, I started taking trazodone that I had been prescribed some months ago for sleep but had not really taken (thus, I believed it was only a sleep aid). Three night later, I woke up sweating and throwing up, with my heart racing and everything spinning and shaking. I called EMTs, and they told me I had a mild case of serotonin syndrome, and got my vitals stable without having to go to the hospital. I immediately quit the trazodone and took a day off the Escitalopram. Felt better within a day and resumed taking it, only to have a very similar (albeit less severe) experience. Took another day off, felt better, just took half today, and almost immediately started feeling detached and unfamiliar with my surroundings and sick to my stomach. I feel like my kids are strangers. Only my husband is familiar (talking to him is the only thing that's helping). It seems like the panicky part comes in waves and stops after 30-60 minutes, but the general icky feeling and fatigue last longer. This is what it's felt like all three times it's happened. 

 I understand how important it is to take medication consistently... I just completely messed up so extremely badly that I don't know how to get back on track without ruining my own life =(  I know if I stop it cold turkey it'll be bad, but if I take it, it'll be bad? I actually want to take it if it's even possible to get back to where I was, where everything was going great. The times I've taken breaks from it have brought back that same agitated grumpy feeling I don't want.

 Any anecdotes or personal experiences are so appreciated.

 * Has this happened to you? Did you get it under control?
* How do you make yourself feel better when experiencing these symptoms? What tricks do you have?
* Do you think the good times were just a fluke and this medication might just keep doing this to me forever?

I think about suicide everyday,"Hi y'all, hope you r all feeling good and loved.

I'm writing this cause i really don't know what to do with the sadness and emptyness I've been feeling about my entire life on this moment.

I have this feeling that I feel depressed since I was a kid, maybe even a baby.

To start, lemme tell you a briefing of who am I:
Im brazilian. Ive lived here my entire life. I came from a poor family, with no college background or any degrees. My parents are the youngest child from both families, which means thei're the only ones that finished highschool. Im almost 26 now and I am openly gay since i was 16.

Throughout my childhood I've always been a kind kid, sensitive and well educated. Mom always taught me to enjoying reading, and I was often considered by many of the adults a ""really smart/intelligent kid"".

I grew up thinking that, as i always studied hard, i would be successful, as it turned out that actually what really matters is how heavy your bank account is.

Since i finished highschool i had to choose between work or work, there wasn't money or space to college, and that hited reeeeally hard at the time, actually, it still does.

Nowadays i have a boyfriend (5y relationship till now) that actually discovered themself as a non-binary person, which was a struggle in the begging since i always identified myself as cis gay man, so i feel most (only) attracted by masculine boys, and he's on hormones for a while now (1year and a half) and somethings are changed, of course. I still love they, but miss the -him-, if you get me :/

My partner always had luck in life. My father in law has a degree on administration and lots of post graduation and qualifications which means a lot of pressure to become successful, for both of us 

Point is that anything brings me joy anymore.
My family and friends always says I'm such a good friend, always available, always kind, very talkative and charismatic but, at the same time, I have never been hired for more than 1 year and a half in a job before. People always say that im nice, and cool, and fun, but even giving my entire energy, physically and mentally, to every job I had, seems like it's never enough.

I just got fired few months ago and with no reason at all, and now I'm constantly considering suicide, just don't have the balls for that. 
I feel like there is no point at all on living, marrying, getting a degree, travelling... I realized that i actually i feel this emptyness since forever, and I can't find reasons to go on. 

How do you get out of this darkness in life? How to become -again- a positive thinking person if everything it's always shit all the time, and randomly shit seems to happen all the time bringing me down more and more everytime. How to manage that? I've conaulted periodically a psychiatrist in the past but never helped.

I haven’t had a bath for the last 23 days,"Everything was going great. I was getting the calories I needed to gain weight. I was working out to combat my scoliosis and just getting results. I had plans to read certain books. I was on a path towards being my ideal self. I was going to focus on myself now that my classes were online and I had quit my job.

At first I just didn’t have clean clothes to wear after having a bath since I had procrastinated to put them in the washer, so I kept postponing having a bath. I was busy crying and being a mess the first week for some reasons. I realized that the lack of any responsibilities felt good. It was one of those times when you say to yourself “Damn I haven’t showered for such a long time, better get my shit together”, you know, the time when it’s not stupid abnormal yet. It felt great. Not being in some cubicle in a tiny filthy bathroom waiting to remember to turn off the water. Not having to prepare clothes. Not having to interact with anyone downstairs. Not having to feel stressed that having baths means more clothes are getting dirty and soon I would have to put them back in washer&amp;dryer. Not having to stress where to put my towel. Not having to remind myself of all the wrong things in my life. 

Sometimes around the second week, I realized the amount of days were getting crazy. I remembered texting my only friend(friends? they are identical twins) that I couldn’t speak to him on the phone because I was going to have a bath. It was March 12 when I had texted this, the last day I had had a bath. Since then, it has been more of a wearing this personal record as a badge of honor and seeing it get bigger, rather than to enjoy the lack of responsibilities. Turns out self-sabotage feels just as good as being lazy. I spent my life chasing ideals that were made up in miserable daydreaming sessions, I have always wanted to be someone I wasn’t. I always accused myself of being a failure for not being that ideal person. Maybe, for once, I feel content for accepting being the filthy&amp;failed person I had always accused myself to be. At least now I’m the same person in my ideal and reality. I don’t have to be the shadow of someone unreal anymore. Remove your expectancies when hope starts hurting.

I had had baths my entire life. They never helped. There has always been a million other things that made me ashamed of myself anyway, smelling terrible would only compliment. I’m not planning to have a bath in the future. Have bath, need to have bath again, bath, need to have bath again… Clothes to clean and towels to hang. It never ends. Things like having baths only matter when there are things inbetween those baths that are worth the effort. It’s not the end, it’s just a means. If there is no end, means aren’t necessary anymore. Nothing changed in my life since not having baths and not doing any responsibility. It’s the same endless life.",enviouslullaby,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12b86wh/i_havent_had_a_bath_for_the_last_23_days/

"Recently, I've officially reached the lowest point of my depression, which surprisingly is not a suicide attempt.","
In the course of the past 11 years (I am 19 at the moment) I've attempted to kill myself 6 times. The depression and my fear of loss derive from multiple traumas in my life, but their roots are sourced at the event of my grandma dying of cancer in my arms while I was 8 years old.

I've felt empty, sad, hurt and angry ever since. I always thought that each suicide attempt was the lowest of lows throughout my battle with depression but a few months ago, I officially hit rock bottom.

I was walking around in the evening/night trying to clear my head but it didn't work. I kept having thoughts rush through my head over and over again, without me even being able to realise what they were. And then I felt the ""Call of The Void"". I wanted to kill myself so bad, that... it scared me.

Then, the first moment of this time started. I called a suicide hotline. The operator talked to me for about 15 minutes before I hung up and went home. The next day, I looked for a psychologist and I've gotten my first ever appointment. THIS is the sign that I'm doing more miserable than ever, because my brain tells me, that I can't deal with this on my own and that I need help. It never happened before.

After a few talks and tests with said doctor, I was finally given a diagnose: Major Depression, a severe case of fear of loss and social phobia. I'm at an 80% estimated suicide risk.

The issue is: I'm scared of treatment. I've lived with depression so long, that I can't really remember what it feels like to not have it. I'm used to it and know how to ""properly"" live with it. Honestly, I don't want the treatment because ""getting rid"" (I know that depression is hardly curable) of the depression would be a huge change in my life and I'm not sure if I'm ready for it",Bananaracoon15,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12awnkx/recently_ive_officially_reached_the_lowest_point/
I'm not sure what to do,"28 M here, I've dealt with sadness and depression most of my life and at times i feel like I have part of it figured out and others I'm completely lost.

Things are a bit complicated because I'm married but I can't talk to my wife like I should be able to and although most of my depression issues stem from before I met her, some of my current issues are from things between us. 

I haven't read the rules on here but i was wondering if anyone knows of a group (anonymous or otherwise) that I can join to talk to persons or if anyone wants to either start one or talk one on one. I don't really have any friends and I'd like very much if I can form some genuine friendships and find people to talk to.

"Those who understand, don't care. Those who care, don't understand.","I've struggled like this for a long time. All the classic issues that come naturally, lack of energy, lack of interest in living life, thoughts of a quick and blissful end. Like every muscle is clenched and there is TV static playing in my head 24/7. I've discovered so many wonderful things about myself in my short 28 years. 

I have this need to put others happiness ahead of mine. Often to my own detriment. I've been taken advantage of financially by many people because of this including my own family. This feeds naturally into my pathological need to be reliable, despite having never been any more than passable at anything I've ever tried. People keep encouraging me to take the next step. You are so good at drawing, you should be an artist. You are such a good DM, you should do it professionally. You are such a good supervisor, you should go for manager. I feel like they want me to stick my neck out so they don't have to put as much effort into stomping it.

I've become quick to anger as well. This is a more recent development. All my life I've been treated like a ticking time bomb for some reason. It used to take a lot for me to get pissed off. I could argue for nearly an hour before finally being convinced that I was in fact in a bad mood. Now I find myself snapping at the first mention of it. And it could be anything. I stepped to hard. I sighed. I didn't answer right away. Most people don't even like being in the same room as me.

Maybe I'm just touch-starved. I'm a physical comfort kind of guy. Is it really too much to ask that someone hold me once in a while. Even for a moment, I'd like someone to reassure me and genuinely mean it. Maybe I'm just being selfish in wanting that.

My family are no help. They don't get it, and I've explained it to them. All I get are stories about how depressed they are. How horrible their lives are. I shouldn't be depressed because they have it so much worse. 

My very few friends are no help. One keeps mentioning how helpful his God has been in keeping him happy. Another keeps talking about doing herself in, and how horrible my constant sadness makes her feel. I'm sorry I can't have the kind of depression that makes me bubbly and fun to be around. I told her to let me know when she is gonna do it, at least then I could use it as an excuse.

All I really do anymore between work and sleep is browse the cesspool that is Facebook finding nothing but hate. Watch videos that don't interest me on YouTube, watching people be more successful than me doing what they love. Browse reddit looking for I don't even know what. Contemplating. Maybe one day I'll work up the nerve.",Nu11AndV0id,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12aw8ms/those_who_understand_dont_care_those_who_care/

"Got dumped for no reason, everything is awful","My girlfriend of almost 4 years (living together for almost 3) just ended things the other day. She hadn't been happy in life for a while and was having doubts about the future. I suppose she decided to keep that to herself instead of telling me until it was too late.

It began with her wanting space for a few days to see how it was being alone, I would go out during the times she was home and try to minimize my presence to give the place more of a single occupant feel. On Friday we finally talked and she confirmed that she wanted to end things because she doesn't think she can be happy in a long term relationship. She kept insisting that it wasn't anything I did but her own mental state. Not like it makes it any easier, if I did nothing wrong then why am I being punished? I understand her reasons and I want her to be happy but it has been tearing me up inside thinking that I could have done anything if she had told me sooner.

I have never loved anyone like I have her, I was so prepared to spend the rest of my life with her and I don't think I could ever find another like her.

Not eating / struggling too.,"Hey ya'll, 30y.o male here.

Have had a very frustrating year and a half since 2021 when I lost a job and relocated back near my hometown. Following a medical restriction, I've basically struggled to find work that even meets my bare minimum needs, kind of took a leap to just do some of my own contracting instead of earning less doing the exact same work for someone else, basically doing renno's/simple paint jobs and helping another GC here.

Well, work for the season finished up in Nov, my savings from helping that contractor allowed me to last until Jan, but I've been basically insolvent since applying to jobs and hoping to hear back on renno's that haven't happened. I'm officially out of money once more in general minus the odd copy-editor online work that nets like $150/300 for a book. If I did have a renno, within 3 or 4 days of paint and dry wall I could literally meet all my payments and actually have money again, I made the mistake of putting all my eggs into that basket because the contractor I helped had told me they were wanting to stop painting entirely and if I'd wanna take the quotes they were prepping for spring. Like Jan, none of those have actually gone forward. Lol I have a combined value right now of $-45 plus 6k credit debt that I've managed to keep making minimums on just to save the interest from rolling over, but as of Apr. 1 just plain am out of all my money.

Basically over the last month for sure and a little before that, because of a mix of stress, motivation, lack of appetite, etc, I sometimes don't eat. Sometimes I just hit 4 pm and wonder why I feel like my body is air, that kinda stuff.

But when you're already that hungry it's almost like appetite works the other way, like I'll try and eat and my body just doesn't want it by then.

But having no money, I have no basic breakfast foods, no milk, etc, nothing that's really 'easy to make' without some prep. I've basically been eating rice and frozen veggies plus the last freezer burnt meats I still have, lol.

I know it's totally undercutting your whole body too to be doing this too yourself, but I also just kind of don't want too eat, or care, because it's all just more labor. Eating is dishes, dishes means using water, using water means more utility I cannot afford, etc.

I should hear within a week or 2 if one of the latest interviews I'd done goes ahead, but even just the medical restriction makes shit hard. Because of a minor seizure risk I can't drive, and even jobs that are indoor here still list having your drivers license as a requirement half the time, while ones that actually require it are flat out off limits.

I've tried finding work online, internet connection doesn't meet requirements of a lot of C/S type roles because speed is too slow, plus like I literally sweat when I have to speak on the phone lol.

I've done jobs from gravekeeping to tree planting to retail, working ag, working concrete, painting, drywall, etc, all manual labor and some management shit, and it still feels like my work experience is moot and all I have access to is minimum. I have not felt like I've been able to build savings again since like 2019, and now I struggle to even find work, or even the give-a-fuck to eat anymore.",StuckInsideYourWalls,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12ayu31/not_eating_struggling_too/

I hate everything about myself down to my skin color and I've debated with myself on if it might be depression, but I've never brought it up to my parents because they don't really believe in that stuff, and I've never talked to a doctor because i feel like being diagnosed with depression will make me feel worse about myself. That's also why I haven't seen or brought up a therapist because I feel like going to one makes you admit that you have a problem or bad mental health which I feel would be bad for me. I don't have any friends (I do have a partner though), and I'm constantly reminded of it all the time at school. I also hate school. I Have no motivation to do schoolwork or work in general. I also have a crippling fear of being poor and alone when I get older, having dreams of being rich and failing to make that happen. I just really don't know what to do with my life, my 16th birthday is at the end of the year and with all the pressure from my family to have a good job, good life, good grades, and everything else everything is kind of crumbling right now. I feel like I focus on things I can't have a lot because unfortunately the things I want most in life i can't have right now because of strict parents. I see all these other kids doing things I wish I could, and it makes me feel even worse about myself that just looks and personality. I wish there was someone in my life that just understands but I have no one. I really just don't know what to do. I feel like the easy fix would be to just stop caring, do better, and listen to your parents but I just can't.

It’s getting worse,"Currently being ignored by a girl i asked out and when i reach out to my friends for help they don’t help. 

This was even before the ask out, but my depression is getting worse. Im currently a senior in high school about 2 months away from graduating, i dont have a lot of friends. I realized how serious this is gonna be on my life i got super sad and still currently am, I lonely as hell, feel useless and i cry at least once per day.  I’ve heard that once people graduate, all the friendships you made in high school start to die down and you lose lots of friends, i cant live with that.

An insight that took me a long time to accept,"I’ve dealt with anxiety and depression on and off (more on than off) since my teenage years. I was in denial about this fact for a long time because (even though I would never judge someone else’s struggle or situation) I saw it as a sign of weakness in myself. Or some kind of personal failure. 

What I’ve realized over a long period of time and a lot of reflection is that the way I’m wired is just fundamentally prone to depression/anxiety. I feel like my brain just works differently than people who don’t have the same struggles. 

Accepting this fact - that depression is simply a part of my wiring - has actually been really helpful to me in moving forward and accepting myself enough to get treatment. I decided to try an SSRI a few years ago, and I’m doing way better than before the treatment. I’ve also been able to be a source of support and encouragement to friends of mine who have struggled, and subsequently had success with SSRI medication. 

I don’t claim to have the answers. And I don’t want to give the impression that my acceptance is a kind of admission of futility - much the opposite, actually. Now, I accept the fact that I’m just prone to feeling low. I can joke about it and laugh at it. It’s part of what makes me who I am, and there are positive aspects in my personality that have come from it - namely: resilience, grit, empathy. (Though I’m certainly still working on these things, and have a long way to go).

I wanted to share this with you all, and maybe see if this could start a discussion. Has anyone’s experience been similar? Do you think it might be helpful sometimes to reframe the way that we think about depression?",Pristine_Lack9096,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12aqnd4/an_insight_that_took_me_a_long_time_to_accept/
Adderall,"Adderall. Adderall is the cure for depression in the worst way possible. I cannot describe my feelings toward the pill. I know what it looks like for someone's life to be ruined by it. My whole life my mom has been abusing it. My parents will fight and fight about it. Like big fight. Tables flipped, beer bottles smashed, bloody faces. My dad is an ex-heroin addict, and he got into heroin because of Adderall. He hates watching his wife slowly die because of Adderall. I tried to kill myself on March 20th, 2023. I was sent to forest view mental hospital. When I was there, I was so curious about this drug. I lied and lied to the psychiatrist until I was on an insane amount of Adderall. 40 mg each morning. This shit got rid of every symptom of my depression. I couldn't feel depressed because I couldn't feel anything. Nothing. I had a ton of motivation and could leave my bed. I had a ton of adrenaline and could be active and run. I wasn't constantly stuffing my face with food, I could actually eat balanced meals. I could do schoolwork and had motivation. None of it really helps with my ADHD. It just makes me even more shaky and bouncy. Eyes darting around like a fucking crackhead. So then I'm stabilized with two medications that make me super drowsy. I mean, I guess this is good. The thing is, I'm super addicted. I constantly am craving it. My parents make me take less than I'm prescribed but it makes me super shaky and wanting more. But I think my moms doing it so she can take mine. I found an empty capsule in my room as if she had snorted it. Adderall cures my depression by killing me with an addiction disorder. A brand new mental health disorder to fuck me up.

What do I do?,"Hi everyone,

I don’t really want to get in to my sob story but you have to hear it to understand where I’m at. I’m in my mid 50s and have never really had a life. I was very smart when I was young, got into great colleges. My childhood was perfect. It all changed when I graduated from HS. Not a month after I developed one of the most painful headache conditions known to man. Starting 2nd year of college they destroyed my life and have to this day. No corporation will ever hire someone who has had to miss 2 semesters of college and 1 of grad school or had employment gaps due to a chronic problem. I wasnt even in the mindset for going into business for myself, didn’t think of it, it wasn’t the big thing in the late 80s. And how could I? I was 100% unreliable due to headaches. I exhausted everything medically, eventually lost my crappy contractor job and after exhausting all of my savings trying to stave off moving home, I had to move home. I was 39. I’m fortunate to have had generous and loving parents. I knew when I moved home I’d never work again. Even then I tried, had great interviews, my education alone got me in the door, but no one would ever hire me. Too many desperate financial people in my area bc of the GFC made it even harder for me to find work. Meanwhile my parents Got older. My dad had been hit by a teenage drunk driver a month before I graduated from college, never worked again. Has had to be supervised for the last 30 years. That was hard but it didn’t wreck my life. My health did. Anyway parents got older, developed old age issues. Now I’m a caregiver. I took care of my mom for 3 years before she died, which was a special kind of fun. I hope none of you get to experience that. I wake up every morning regretting every single second I took care of her bc it was so awful. Now my poor dad is losing it And I don’t know if I can do this again especially after the existence I’ve lead. My dad has enough money to be impoverished by a nursing home but then me - dutiful son who expected to inherit enough to live on bc I was unable to have a career and bc I took care of them for free - will get nothing. Sorry for subjecting you to this and it is true, unfortunately.   


What’s the point of me going on? Seriously? I’ve had no joy in my life except my cats since 1987. Sure I’ve had healthy years, friends etc, but in the end not one person will ever even notice if I’m gone. I’ve accomplished nothing. I have a couple of Rolexes I refuse to part with bc they are literally the only things of value I have left that I bought myself. What’s the point? I’m 55. Its been over for 10 or 15 years. I’m not going to do anything to myself, that’s why I’m here, but can someone tell me what’s the point of a useless life? I despise bill gates and I didn’t grow up lower class, closer to upper class, but by circumstance and being unfortunate I’m now lower class. i now get his useless eater point. Im a drain on society. I dread getting up every day. I hate life. What do I do? I already see a shrink and he’s not the answer. Creating a life, being able to earn money on non stale skills while still being unreliable due to headaches is the goal. Is it possible?

i don’t know what i’m doing or what i should be doing.,Honestly i’ve dealt with shit for as long as i can remember and never once had the urge or though of suicide except for a quick sarcastic joke. lately i’m tired and sad and mostly angry about the way my life is going.

I feel like I’m wasting away my life and don’t have the energy to change,"I had so much hope coming out of college. Had a really strong support circle, all these aspirations, young, just 22 years old. 

Now it feels like it’s all over. I’m almost 30 and I have no close friends or family near me, I hate every minute of my job, no motivation to get up in the morning, always tired and just wanna sleep the days away. The worst feeling is in my gut knowing it’s not gonna get any better, feeling that this is the trajectory my life will take. Watching people I grew up with all surpass me and find happiness and comfort, families, meaning. I have passions but rarely have the energy to chase them with how bogged down I feel at work and in my volunteer work, neither of which give me true happiness anymore.

I've been struggling lately in life since everything goes down currently in my position...

I clearly don't know why I'm doing this or expect to get from everything I write now but something in my head tells me to share what goes on in my head and hope to feel somehow better after this so please don't judge about my english im not that good in this language im trying my best.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

1. What my depression is

\- No motivation, Not feeling like doing anything you want neither what you need to do

\- Feeling sick even if you're healthy like phantompain \[Heart pain, Shortbreath, panic attacks\]

\- Getting bad habbits like smoking alot, drink alot or a overdose of pornographic material

\- Loss of timesense like you skip day for day and you feel like you just exist but aren't alive

\- Isolation like you don't feel safe or feel right and you stay more at home even skipping work/school

\- Anger/Emotion issues that are triggerd by the smallest amount of stress/problems

\- No happiness not even a glimmer of that and all you feel is sadness, anger and alot of thoughts why   
  you're even here

\- Nothing pleases you anymore 

\- Manipulating other people in your surruondings to keep your distance 

\- 24/7 Media &amp; nonstop consume of videos to let the time fly just to get to sleep again

And more...

&amp;#x200B;

2. What disturbs the peace in my mind

\- Got bullied, so I ate alot and got fat. After I got fat I couldn't look at myself in the mirror so I stopped eating for 2 Months and lost almost 25kg. The reward was gallstones and even that I ignored it for 2 years even almost died because my  gallbladder got ripped and had a emergency operation. After all that I still can't eat without pain that comes after the meal.

\- Got a girlfriend and dedicated her my entire life, so I dropped my Work, School and did everything to make her life a better one than mine. Gave almost every single € away just to make us a life that would show her a world without problems but now I can't keep it up. Now its 3 years since and I regret everything and can't reverse it. We got in a toxic relationship but I can't let go of her... she's the only person I talk to and she's the last thing that keeps me alive.

\- Had a bike accident. Crashed with 120 Km/h frontal into a car broke my Arm, Leg and multiple deep cuts on my body that are strong visible and now I suffer from  arthrosis that came from that crash that hurts as hell when I just wanna sit down or stand up.

\- Got in debts since germany gives you insurance even if you can't afford it you gotta pay it that is 800€ monthly and gotta pay it or I have to go to court.

\- Lost all interest in everything since school started in my youth so I did go into the woods early in the morning till evening I was sleeping where I could find peace and when my bus would arive from school I would go home so my parents would not notice I wasnt even in school.

\- Got alot of insecurities about social life. I can't be around people without being paranoid because once I got betrayed by friends that called me on a more or less hidden yard where like 15+ people beat me up thats why I can't keep peacefully without looking if there are people doing this again.

\- Got once all my energy back and was working in a hookah bar after my shift I was walking to my car and not a long time ago I had a breakup with a Girl and her Brother was on the parking lot at night and was beating me because his sister told him I made her depressed and messed up her life that made me paranoid even more.

And much more but that are some things that I cant talk about...

&amp;#x200B;

3. My journey to a normal life

\- Not possible because I get a glimmer of motivation but once I get to a point I stop everything I am doing and go back into bed or just go back to watch videos till nighttime

&amp;#x200B;

And thats stopping me I don't know how to stop this

How can I support someone without burning out?,"I have an ex (as of one year) who I am still in contact with (mostly in terms of a supportive friendship). She recently got dumped, and is now experiencing suicidal depression. She's started seeing a psychiatrist, who gave her antidepressants and benzos, but I feel like the benzos (triazolam) are displaying bad side effects already (just two weeks later).

I've ended up being her primary support, and have had to be available at any time of day or night to try to talk her down if she is feeling suicidal or anxious. I basically live in a state of constant fear and anxiety. I can't sleep well and have no interest in food due to feelings of anxiety; literally every day (she will call 2-4 times a day) I have to struggle with her demons, her traumatic memories (the man who broke up with her was very cruel), and her urge to end it all via various methods.

I don't know what to do. I can't just abandon her--I feel like her very life depends on me. But I can't eat or sleep, and my work has been negatively affected. I can't be present for any friends or family because I have to be responsive to her 24/7. As soon as she goes to sleep, I have a few moments of peace before I start being anxious about when she wakes up and the intrusive thoughts she will be experiencing.

She has other friends and she will talk to them sometimes, but she doesn't trust most people right now because she thinks they won't understand her; and she's not interested in counseling (only psychiatric meds). I'm her only support.

I'm on a tropical island with my family, looking at the ocean with a drink in my hand. And all I can think is ""They'd be happier without you.""

depression &amp; anxiety feels like it’s coming back,"I had and overcome depression &amp; anxiety 2yr ago roughly now, not fully but enough to stop thinking that way. It came down to money and my job at the time that belittled me massively.
My partner worked there and we just done our jobs but I got picked on for some reason by management even tho I’d done my fair share. Over the years working there it become a life that I had to work there for the rest of my days and it got me depressed. Covid hit I lost my uncle,the job become hectic (supermarket) and other things on top but I bottled it up. 
I left the job after covid 2020 and joined another job which was ok with nice people but with the way I felt the job in hand seemed challenging. It got to a point I couldn’t count 1-10 and I had todo this multiple times picking orders. I lasted 6weeks before a phone call on break to my partner I felt like not coming home and running on the runway of the airport.

I left and found a job at the airport and pushed the boundaries and thoughts I had. 10 months later in my job I feel so much more confident and feel I can go further in life. I also fell in love again with another girl at the workplace and we’ve been talking for maybe 5months and we’ve both separated from our partners and the pressure and anxiety is hitting hard again as I don’t know if she likes me the way I feel for her. I feel I’m crumbling again overthinking things we’ve spoke about or what to say. I’ve been out the dating game for 14years and it’s starting to tell. I few work colleagues have found out and said they hope it works and one even saying he thinks she’s mad for me but I can’t tell. Bottling it up again as there’s nobody really to talk to is the only option and I fear I go down that route again.",SquirrelVegetable832,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12ar2k2/depression_anxiety_feels_like_its_coming_back/

I feel like I've lost my entire world and it's impossible for me to see how life will ever be meaningful again. I just wanted to spend my life loving her, making her happy, and feeling her love.

"I’m sick and my dad forced me to clean my depression nest, now he’s acting cold to me","I just got my appendix removed almost 2 weeks ago, and on top of that the past few days I’ve been feeling awful (sinus infection). I always have trouble maintaining a clean room, and it was really bad this time around. Cat litter box overfilled, garbage everywhere, ect. My dad decided that *today*, where I’m feeling the crummiest and just want to sleep, was the day to scold me and make me clean. He tells me how important this is to him, and how many sacrifices he makes for me and that this is the least I can do, but I never change. Now, he’s threatening to send my cat away.

Working in sales with clinical depression and anxiety,"I recently took up a new job in sales, and I like the work and everything, but the problem is I went into this having clinical depression and anxiety.

cringe thoughts about sealing the deal,"of sealing the deal on this life. its stupid but i cant stand it anymore. Even though I am the worst person I know, lazy fat disgusting all that stuff. I am also very selfish and I want to be alive still.

Days go by wishing I would have been someone else but thats too late. I am stuck in this body this mind until I die. That's why I want to die. Imagine being with someone you despise 24 7, and the only vacation is when you are asleep or distracted with media, wouldn't you avoid reality at all cost? Well that cost me academic failure and my reputation is down in the dumps. I like the people here, I like things here and I think some people might not even hate me but its too late. I am a pathological liar, in debt due to bulimia and failed classes, my childhood goals and aspirations seems like an out of pocket dream. I cannot see myself being happy the way I am now, maybe if I didn't fail classes, maybe if I was 100lbs maybe if I had friends i would have been. But also I am thinking I am in a major I excelled in (at least early on in the semester)  but day dreaming a future on said major feel disgusting. Political Science seems like a dumb thing to study and find a job in, and even if I do find a job, get married have kids I don't think that would make me happy at all. I always wanted to do mathematics, since I failed my intermediate calculus class in december my academic advisor told me not pursue anything regarding mathematics. And now I am stuck in a hell hole I built for myself. All because me and my stupid decisions. 

Guilt is the primary reason I am suicidal but it's the primary reason I am alive. Without it I would have killed myself, since I am only alive to not make my parents sad. But I am a pathological liar, they have no idea about anything at all. And every day I feel like I dissapoint them, so I lie I lie about everything. I feel so jealous seeing people honest with their parents. I feel so sad that I made this relationship bad,

I am all the blame. I am the sin, I am the sinner. I want to kill myself but guilt prevents me. I also have been threathned by my dad before. I was 14 I was on a trip with him, we werent getting along, I felt like I wasn't in the right place and didn't enjoy the activities and conferences he made me go with him. I guess i said I wanted to die, he said if I were to kms he would too. He said he didnt care about my mom and he would just take his own life. He said the only reason they were married was because of me and if I were going to be depressed and not take the chances he given me, he should have took an orphan kid to this trip with him as they would have been more grateful.

Would Just Appreciate A Listen,"Can't post this to relationship advice because he might see it. Sorry for this being long and boring but if you read this just know I appreciate you. I've been dating a guy for 2.5 years. About a year ago he asked me to move into the house he bought and also to pay rent. He chose the house without me, it's far from my job, and I'm not sure how I feel about being used for passive income.

Since he moved we see each other less. He used to come over 2x/week. Now I go to his place once a week and he doesn't come over at all. I work the whole weekend and also during the week (full time) while he has a typical 9-5. One day a week before he started his new job, he would work from home and that's the day I'd visit. So, he has to be getting paid to hang out with me? That would sound like a weird thing to think, if he wasn't obsessed with money. Always talking about saving this saving that, waiting for his next paycheck in the mail, taking on extra side work. He's also obsessed with buying guns.

At his new job, there's no work from home, so one day a week I go over after 5pm and leave in the morning as he goes to work. We watch a show, go to bed, and wake up.

There were weeks where we wouldn't text for six days straight. Two days after Valentine's Day (we didn't celebrate obv), I told him I need to see him 2x/week minimum and a daily text. Essentially forcing him to do stuff he doesn't want to do or I'll break up. He seemed upset and said he didn't know I was hurting and that he will do better. I tried to give him his house keys back and his stuff but he said to keep them.

From mid Feb till Easter coming up, he invited me to 1 hockey game, 1 Easter gathering, and 1 couples massage that we never scheduled. I hate sports and I go to bed way early, and it was on a night between 10 hour shifts at my job. He went with someone else, which is fine, but did he invite me just so he could retort that hey I made time for you but you didn't want it? Ok he did come over for like an hour \*one\* time, but it was conveniently on the way to the side job he had that night. So that leaves plenty of weeks where he did nothing about it.

It's not like he's busy. He says his new job is gravy and barely does any work. He still makes time to do his side work, and sees his friends once or twice a week. So if he can see his friends twice a week, he can see me twice a week. I'm not saying see them less. I'm saying see me more. Twice or zero.

I've been in distress because I don't have friends or family nearby and haven't for years. Through college I didn't make a single friend. I have long term depression, general anxiety, social anxiety. I've been to the psychologist and the psychiatrist, they don't help. I'm going to live out my days with my cat. I can't remember the last time I had fun, felt alive, or had a genuine laugh. It feels like the next 40 years are going to be the exact same.

I have one hobby. There is nothing else I like. But even with my hobby I have to push myself to do it, and it's like trying to start a dead car. Anything I try to enjoy it feels like a coping mechanism. Trying to escape from my thoughts. I'm constantly ruminating. 

He will do little stuff for me but it's not what I asked for. Like buy me a small gift or buy my cat a gift if he's at the store. Always offers to pick up something for me if he's out. Is thoughtful about my migraines like getting up to shut the blinds even if I didn't ask. Offers to cook for me but I have an eating disorder. Knows I don't like being tickled so he stopped. He does text me nearly every day but when he misses a day it feels like I'm being torn to pieces. 

I'm grasping at straws for an excuse that he loves me. He always seems to think everything is fine. I'm thinking about dropping the house keys off one day when he's not home and never seeing him again. I haven't seen him since Thursday so I'm already into the healing process. I'm not answering his text. I don't know what to say that I haven't already said. If you wanted to be with me, you would.

TLDR: I'm being rejected yet again by yet another guy and it just gets harder and harder. Also I'm always depressed.",ExcellentRope30,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12azrp6/would_just_appreciate_a_listen/
medication or lose all creativity?,"I got put in a tough spot a few months ago--I'm on grant abroad, and though I was promised my meds would come to me by mail, they never did. So I got stuck going off two of my four meds (latuda and trintellix) cold turkey because they're not available in the country I'm in. Managed to get a doctor here to give me scripts for the other two (lamictal and ativan), so I'm not completely unmedicated.

After the withdrawals faded, I faced an interesting reality. I got my creativity back. This means so much to me--writing is all I have to live for, other than my cats. I was trying to always write while on all the drugs, but what came out was horrible and stilted. It's like I can do words again, and that's great.

The problem is that my emotions came back too. So when I'm not actively writing, I'm filled with hopelessness and intense self-hatred about every part of me. (Even my writing! While I'm actively typing words, I'm lost in my made-up world and all is good, but the instant I stop, I just start spiraling, thinking why even write, everything you write is trash, this is a self-indulgent waste of time, and so on.) I had these thoughts while on meds, but I couldn't feel them, if that makes sense. Now I do, and I spend a lot of time crying or just sitting and staring at the wall wishing something would come kill me.

I'm basically stuck in this situation until June when I go back home. But once I do...is it better to go back on those meds and lose the ability to do the one thing that means anything to me in this shitty pointless life in order to stop feeling again so that I can take care of mundane tasks of life (school, work), or stay off them and try to figure out some way to live with these constant debilitating feelings of self-hatred and hopelessness? Before anyone suggests it, I already get exercise, eat healthy, go to therapy, so on and so on. Nothing makes these feelings stop but drugs. But drugs take my words away.

Constant passive thoughts of non-existence?,"So I've recently been diagnosed with severe depression, which was kind of surprising to me. I knew I had some form of depression but kind of brushed it off as not that big of a deal. But I started going to therapy and I was told that it's not actually ""normal"" to constantly have passive thoughts of.... just not existing?

I don't want to do anything drastic, no plans or anything. I don't even really think about death exactly. It's just that I'll sometimes think it would be nice to not exist, like *poof* and then I wouldn't have to deal with rent, taxes, work, etc. But apparently having these kinds of thoughts nearly everyday means I have severe depression.

I'm the only one on the project that they completely forgot about even though I played a major role in putting it together. Now everyone's careers are taking off and everyone is congratulating me on a project that completely forgot about me. It's embarrassing and painful.

Even worse, my luck has took a turn for the worse. Everything that could go wrong has went wrong. I'm now homeless and living in my car. I have no friends, no family, and only 10 dollars to my name. There's no getting out of a situation like this.

I'm so proud of my work on the project. And overjoyed for it's success. But I deserve to be recognized too.

I tried to find myself to be happy and able to laughing,"Since I am first year in college, it changed my life and I do not laugh or be happy anymore. Somehow it developed my mental health than in my past. My ex tried to make me happy or laugh, but mostly I was fake laugh because I do not feel my emotions.  Til two months ago my ex girlfriend left me. We were together for 3 years after it was catastrophically.  I am only 28 years old and most of all students are under 22 ages.  I am too careful with them, because I don’t want to get trouble with younger adults.
But I have only few friends. They always checked on me if I am okay.  I really appreciate about that. I tried to explain about my mental health but my family and friends don’t understand how I feel.

I cried everyday when I wake up because of my dream about my ex girlfriend.  I tried to talk with other women but I have no feel on whoever.  My heart already belonged with my ex girlfriend.

Anyway somehow I managed with my mental health problems to get little better.
I went to see counselor to help me out but it was not successful.  My doctor wants me take a medicine but I don’t want to because that medicine will trigger me if I think about suicide but will help anti anxiety. The reason I refuse take it.  
I feel that college is not right for me but I want to get diploma for to get better pay.

My goal is I want to be happy and able to laugh with friends or family.  And I want to change back to who I am in past instead of new myself.  I don’t really like new myself. It was very different.  I want to workout with my ex girlfriend again. Because she understands and always supportive me 100%

Why is the deck so heavily stacked against me,"This is going to sound batty but bare with me.
I've been married once in my life, but I have been divorced 5 times and am going for the sixth now.
Like I said ""batty"". After a few grand paid into several divorces the courts have screwed it up every time either at the beginning or the end. I've been destitute for several years due to this. The first time I filed I had a divorce attorney put my paper work together with all of the information I needed to make this divorce go smoothly.

This cost $350 and another $350 for filling fees. At which time I received a receipt from the court house and was told I'd be contacted with the dates I'd need to appear. After a month with no contact and being ran through their phone loops without achieving any success of contact with anyone who might be able to help me, I decided to go there and ask in person. I was told I never filled for divorce, so I'd show the receipt and they told me it was fake and insinuating that i was going to be arrested for fraud if i continued. I had copies of the papers laid out in the correct order filled at home so I just made more and paid again.

3 more times I was met with the same result. So when tax season came I hired a lawyer In hopes of better results on this 5th attempt. This time we made it to the courts we went through the entire process. Problem #1 they gave my lawyer paperwork stating I was going to divorce counseling ( no lawyers allowed at these) instead of the actual hearing which was what was actually happening. Come time my lawyer was not present due to this and I was charged with child support including back child support for a child that wasn't mine that my wife explained to them wasn't mine and she did not have this kid. All on the precipice of her being born in a different state. 

I was told by judge Pittman that if I wished to fight this I had to go to Minnesota to do so, even though all parties involved lived in the same city in Michigan. A month or so after all court preceedings were done I was met with a phone call from my lawyer stating that the judge let my divorce time out and I had to go through all of this again. Child support stayed.

It's been 6 years and I can't get back on my feet but I've been lucky enough to with great shame accept money from my elderly mother to hire a lawyer and go through all of this again, though so far every lawyer I've contacted are asking for ridiculous amounts of money ( the last one offered a 2 grand retainment and $270 an hour. Too much cost not enough money) Just prior to the pandemic they suspended my license because I was laid off and searching for a job for 2 weeks. The back child support coupled with that 2 weeks of no pay pushed me just over the $4000 limit. At the time they had recently made a law stating that you couldn't take someone's license for being negligent on cs.

Their solution, put it under a traffic infraction from 3 years prior where I was rear ended by a guy who admitted to going 80 in a 55 while playing on their phone. He got it for reckless driving obviously, and i got nothing because I wasn't at fault. They left a voice-mail telling me they screwed up and I needed to get ahold of the number they provided to fix it. 3 years calling daily but every call was met with a voice-mail box that was already full. When I finally got ahold of someone and met at the court house to have this fixed they told me I really needed to consider getting divorced because it was only going to get worse for me if she had any more kids.

I had everything I could do not to blow up on the spot. For 3 years I worked 2 jobs one 8 miles from home the other 16 miles from home and had to walk for a while until I got my first and only pandemic check and was able to afford a pedal bike. (I was 30 and hadn't rode a bike in a long time so riding 32 miles a day while working 2 jobs was hell) I'm still destitute my business was destroyed by the license suspension (I was a fire performer on the side and was unable to make it to shows due to no transportation) I had to refund everyone who had retained me which left me deep in the red until I had no more ability to continue my passion.

And all of this started with a cheating wife. (Here's a little back story on this one) during the recession my wife and I moved to Minnesota for work. During that time while I was at work she had sex with the neighbor and was impregnated by him. I let her know that I grew up without a father and wouldn't allow my daughter to go through the same, but if it happened again I would put my wife out on the streets without a seconds hesitation. During our time In Minnesota she expressed her concern for her little brother. They were adopted out to different families when he was 1 and she was 3 and they had no contact with eachother since. She didn't know if he was alive or dead or even In the same country. I made a promise to her that if we ever moved back to Michigan I would find him.

Shortly after moving back to Michigan I found him and introduced him to both of his biological sisters and his biological mother. In a nut shell she now has 2 kids by him and I obviously threw her out.",Mindless_Anxiety_379,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12axkxv/why_is_the_deck_so_heavily_stacked_against_me/

Wrong. I feel like a big impostor that lied to everyone - I feel unhappy imagining my life with a woman, raising kids.

Turns out porn was giving me a false idea of sexuality, despite me enjoying it. Now I have to learn how to talk and flirt with women. I used to have female friends, now I'm anxious to talk to them cause there's a lingering thought ""You're gonna get attracted to them and be weird"".

I have no intentions of living past the age of 30,"
This was originally posted on another subreddit but I didn't realize they had a rule against these types of posts. I figure maybe this would be a better place. 



I (18 M) have discovered more and more since going to college that I am not meant or built to live a long life. I've gone from being uncomfortable with this fact to not only liking it but honestly not even wanting to see my 30th birthday. 

Life's hard for everybody, which makes me a little turned off to living it for too long, but for me it's just showed me how incompetent I am. I've failed at almost everything. My latest failure is that I forgot to tell my employer, who recently fired me for my poor time management, where my mailing address was, so now the poor soul may have to re-mail the check when he's already fired my ass. I've had other failures recently too. All of the things that I've gotten up in the morning for I've figured out are over-hyped and basically worthless. 


I'm tired of all the ""good things"" that life teases us only to rip it away and put us on our knees. I may have said at one point that I hated society like I was The Joker or some shit. Now I have much more sympathy for it. It's really just the universe that I hate. Society is trying it's best to fairly play the Universe's cold uncaring game of survival. 


I have no doubt now that non-existence is better. Nothing is nothing yes, but it's also peace. I think I'll keep bullshitting my way through adulthood as long as my life is tolerable and I'm somewhat happy. When I eventually reach the point that I can no longer keep up with life's demands, that will be it.",No_Praline647,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12ambkt/i_have_no_intentions_of_living_past_the_age_of_30/
I’m sick of the life I’m living,"Hi I’m a 19 y/o female.

I’m lost in school, I have a plan to get into nursing but I might not get in. I have no motivation to learn anything, work on myself or go to work. I just hate my life. I’ve been depressed for years (it’s been off an on) and now it all came back and hit me stronger than ever. I feel like school is a big reason also because i feel like my life is so repetitive. I was also diagnosed with Graves’ disease back in summer and gained some weight which makes me even more upset. I work out but nothing seems to work. I sometimes ask myself why I’m even here. I’m scared of death but I think about it so much, how it would be to just let everything go. I know I’m young and I have a family who loves me so I would not want to ever do such thing. I also get really bad intrusive thoughts (worst ones r of my family dying and how painful it wil be ) and this affects me everyday, even if I’m out having fun with my friends I find myself zoning out. I’m just fed up, I’m tired. Nobody understands. My close friend told me I won’t excel in nursing because of the lack of motivation I have in school work and how it’s not my top priority. I know this is reality but this hurt me even more. I know I am smart and capable I just don’t have the motivation for anything man… idk what to do anymore. I’m done my head hurts everyday.

Thinking,"Have you ever stopped and thought about where it all went wrong? Is there a defining moment for you when you realized, 'Oh, hey. That's why I am the way that I am now.' 

Here's mine: we just moved up to North Dakota. I was 14. I had the majority of my room unpacked the first night. We were on roughly move 20 or something just bullshit that you wouldn't believe. My mom walked in and had this look on her face. She must have said something along the lines of, 'Well, we're moving again'. Right then, I lost something. I don't know what broke, but in that moment, I felt broken. I ripped all of my art I had meticulously hung on the walls.  All of it. I crumpled it. Threw it away. I couldn't stand to look at it anymore. I couldn't stand trying to be the person that was happy and full of life and had all these hopes and dreams and desires. I was angry. Lost. I had no friends. My possessions seemed so worthless to me. 

For a long time, I stopped unpacking my boxes. I went through the motions. New school. New you. You can be whoever you want to be when you start over, but I was still stuck in the loop of having to reconstruct myself constantly. I couldn't build meaningful relationships with anybody, so I stopped trying. I stopped living. I became a shell. I stopped looking in the mirror. I honestly don't have a clear picture of what I look like in my head. I see parts of myself, but never the whole.

39 moves later and I still feel like I have no identity. Nothing. Everybody around me has this clear, vivid idea of who I'm supposed to be and who I am, but I don't feel like that person. I don't feel like a mom. I don't feel like a wife. At least not a good one. I don't feel like a coworker. I don't feel like I friend. I don't feel like a sister. I feel hopeless. And lost. I exist just to be here and for what? What am I doing here? I feel like I'm suffocating.

Losing too many friends,"So I have severe depression disorder for the past 3 years, there are a lot of reasons why but right now I feel like a piece of shit. I meet someone, then we become good friends and vibe together, then they ask me about my personal life and keep pestering me about it because it's usual for close friends to know about you. When I reluctantly manage to tell them about my problems and that I have depression, they are all ready to listen to me but look at me in a different way. After a few days they become distant from me and talk shit about me behind my back. And from the people who have told me why them and others don't like is because I am just ""too sad"". I've tried just not being close with people and not interacting with them much but then others think that I'm rude or off putting. Sure, I have made an offensive joke or two with people who I was close with but always apologized if I offended them and over the years I've learnt not to hurt people and really have tried doing my best to make others happy. I try just completely abandoning interactions but my stupid self feels sad about it and I go to make friends only to regret it after a month or 2. I really don't have any support system in my life and I'm a teen living with abusive parents, and the loneliness is killing me.

I Always End Up In The Same Place,"I dropped out of high school at 17 (after years of homeschooling and in-person schooling off and on), and got my GED at 18. I got a part time job the day after, and a couple months later a full time job as well. I worked both for about three weeks and then quit my part time job. I currently work 40HR weeks at my full time job, Monday-Friday.


The full time job that I have is with a family member I live with, we ride together to the office every day, and then back home. That's been really convenient for the both of us. I enjoy seeing my family member at work too, as I do have a certain level of anxiety I haven't gotten over (it used to be much worse, and the primary reason I dropped out of high school). 


Lately I've been depressed, I haven't wanted to go anywhere or do anything, and I've been short with my family members, and often come home from work and walk straight to my room without saying hi and go to sleep for the night, in the clothes I wore to work. It's so similar to the way I was in high school, I just don't care about anything anymore. I have goals; making friends, getting into university, studying abroad, things like that. But I just don't care anymore. Every day I wake up and just resent being conscious. 


I don't know if it's because of my job, because I went from dropping out of high school to working full time so quick when I was not prepared, or if it's just me. I was this way at my part time job, when I was homeschooled, and when I was in high school. I went to therapy for years and was on medication as well, but I stopped about a year ago now. 


I don't know what to do. I don't want to have commitments or responsibilities anymore, I just want to lay in bed and stop trying. It seems like no matter what I do I always end up in the same place mentally. It's a little more stressful now that I have my family member to think about as well, I don't want to cause that person any trouble by quitting. I don't want anyone to have to worry about me anymore either. 


Maybe a full time job was too much for me, everyone told me it was a bad idea but I pushed because I wanted to prove myself. Maybe I just haven't matured because I never had a complete high school experience. I just don't know what to do at this point, and I'm so tired.",ExampleOk4170,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12aox82/i_always_end_up_in_the_same_place/

Colors look brighter after stopping antidepressants,"Hi everyone. Back in 2021 I fell into a deep depression and resorted to Effexor XR. Took 150 mg up until the end of 2022 and started tapering, being now on more than one month off the medication.  


With that said, I started noticing colors being vibrant, particularly in flowers. It is spring now, so it could be an exaggeration of mine, but the color of the flowers near my house just pop like crazy. It's like I've never seen those shades of yellow and purple before.  Sometimes I also notice it in other places, such as bushes being way too green, or buildings. Most things feel the same, but when this happens it feels very strange to say the least.  


I know this probably means the treatment worked, but just so I don't go crazy I need to ask: is this normal? Has anyone experienced this?

I’m too much for everybody. I try not to be but always just end up “a bit too much” for everyone,"
Not in the hyper sense I struggle a lot from depressive episodes and paranoia and it’s hard to keep it all in. I need someone to talk to about it or I WILL explode into a flurry of like 20 messages crying and panicking. It’s out of my control. I’ve lost my best friend of over 5 years due to me being too much and too intense and explosive. My other friend has tried to make me feel better but I’m too much for her too. She told me. I’m too much. I always have been which is why any best friend I have had (before current friend group I only had one friend at a time usually and got too much for them eventually and cycle continues) has left. We are in the same friend group and she says we are “going out friends” who don’t talk personally anymore. I don’t talk to anyone really, are they all going out friends? I’m too much. But that’s because I’m too much for myself so it just overflows out of me constantly and I can’t stop it. My life is taken over by whatever or whoever I am focused on and now that I have no one to focus on I have lost complete control of my whole life and I’m only 20.

I intentionally skip the bus on the way home from work or uni because it’ll be longer before I get home. When I’m in my room I can literally feel the energy being sapped from my body and mind.

I’m depressed and no I can’t change my “mind set”,"I have major depressive disorder along with cPTSD/adhd. I’m 22F. It’s getting harder and harder to manage every day life and I want to just feel something other than bad and unmotivated. I take on the burden of my friends’ mental health issues a lot, which genuinely I don’t mind because I love them. But the other day I was vulnerable like actually vulnerable and not a passive “I’m depressed” comment. Which is rare. My friend called me and we were talking and she stumbled over her words a lot but basically said “you’re not trying hard enough/change your mindset” I tried to explain that my brain literally cannot do that and especially from years of these mental illnesses my brain just doesn’t function like a typical brain does. It was kind of appalling because she also has mental health problems. She seemed also confused because I take medication how can I be “wallowing” in depression. Again, I rarely share a vulnerable side to me like that. How can you explain to someone that even if you’re claiming to do all the things that you’re still unwell? I go to therapy, I take my medication, I try so hard and it’s fruitless. My relationship is failing and all I can hear is “you’ve been depressed for YEARS? Just do something” But I understand that the mental gymnastics of it all wouldn’t be something anyone can see. Anyways, I’m considering TMS.

anyone else have negative experiences with group therapy?,"I've been attending an IOP for depression/anxiety for about a month now, and while i've learned some things and improved in some ways, the negatives seem to be outweighing the positives.

I hate listening to everyone else's terrible situations they're in. I know it's supposed to make you feel like you're not alone, but it just makes my heart hurt that they're suffering and I can't help. And a lot of advice the therapists give is so general, and maybe doesn't apply to my situation, but then I try it anyways and get frustrated. My friends have said that I'm not like myself.

They push the self-help shit so much that I kind of have a new fear of sharing my emotions/situations with friends because it's seen as Unhealthy to depend on others. But friends have noticed and they're concerned and I feel so fucking isolated now that it's seen as ""bad"" to share what I'm going through. And they feel like I'm pushing them away when I want their support more than anything.

Finally it's been giving me active self harm urges which I didn't have before. A girl in my class sometimes hits herself. That's never occurred to me before. And when I'm frustrated or upset now, I have the impulse to do that too. 

This is also supposedly one of the best programs in my area. But I feel like it's changing me and dragging me down in ways I don't like. I miss individual therapy.

I was assaulted several times growing up and went through some pretty bad abuse.

I won't say my life is the absolute worst, I have a roof over my head etc and few people who I guess care. But nonetheless there are many shitty things going on...and depression runs in my family too so I'm not surprised I have come to this point. I didn't wanna have to come to such a conclusion but honestly, I believe we're all gonna go back into nothingness one day so it won't really matter if I return to the nothingness a few years earlier . I've attempted before but this time I'm gonna succeed...I picked a method better than the previous ones and I'm feeling a sense of peace at last. At least I don't have to wake up every day anymore feeling completely worthless, ugly, etc. I hope my cats are well taken care of after I pass, and that the few people who care I guess, forget about me quickly ...that's all I really care about.

To my best friends and sisters and mother sorry I couldn't stay but you'll forget about me soon I know. I hope it becomes dark quickly tonight.

"I don't know, but I keep thinking about this.","Depression is a condition that affects millions of people around the world, and it is often seen as a deviation from the norm. However, this idea of what is considered normal is not an inherent aspect of human nature, but rather a social construct created by capitalist societies.

Capitalism thrives on the idea of productivity and efficiency, and as a result, it creates a culture that values these traits above all else. This creates an environment in which people are expected to constantly perform and achieve, and any deviation from this norm is seen as a failure. Depression, with its symptoms of low energy, lack of motivation, and difficulty concentrating, is therefore seen as a deviation from the norm of productivity and efficiency, and is often stigmatized and misunderstood.

However, what if we were to challenge this idea of normalcy as a construct of capitalism? What if we were to view depression not as a deviation from the norm, but as a form of normalcy in and of itself? After all, depression is a common condition, affecting a significant portion of the population at some point in their lives. Perhaps it is not an aberration, but rather a natural response to the pressures and stresses of modern life.

In fact, some argue that depression is not a disorder, but a form of protest against the inhumanity of capitalist society. In a world where human value is often reduced to productivity and profit, depression can be seen as a rejection of these values, a refusal to participate in a system that places no value on human well-being or fulfillment.

This is not to say that depression should be celebrated or romanticized, or that those who suffer from it should not seek treatment or support. Rather, it is to question the idea of normalcy itself, and to challenge the assumption that those who deviate from it are inherently flawed or abnormal.

By recognizing depression as a form of normalcy, we can begin to challenge the stigmatization and misunderstandings that often surround mental health issues. We can create a more compassionate and understanding society, one that values human well-being and fulfillment over productivity and efficiency. And in doing so, we can begin to create a world in which depression is no longer seen as a deviation from the norm, but as a natural response to the pressures and stresses of modern life.",Faith_Conflict,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12ao7b9/i_dont_know_but_i_keep_thinking_about_this/

Should I take a month off school to focus on my mental health??,"I am currently in a graduate level program set to graduate in Dec 2023. I have struggled with my mental health specially anxiety and depression for over 10 years now and have yearly cycles of depression episodes usually spanning from a few weeks to 1-3 months. This year particularly has been very difficult with my depressive phase beginning in January and has only gotten increasingly worse to cope with.  I check off all the symptoms of depression and anxiety and feel a huge sense of numbness and apathy to almost every part of my life. I check off all the symptoms of depression and anxiety. I am currently in therapy every week and am working with my doctor to begin medication. 

In a few weeks I will be starting a 5-week 5 day a week placement block which requires a lot of energy and planning outside of school. I am very stressed about this since my depression has been so bad these past few months, getting out of bed isn’t even possible some days. Over the past few weeks I’ve only made it to school 1-2 times (I am required to go 3 times a week). 

I discussed options with my program director and there is an option to delay my placement until the next placement block from sept-Nov and the next one from Jan-Mar 2024. My program’s graduation isn’t until May 2024 so I would still be able to graduate with my cohort however, this would delay my school finish date for a few months. 

I am still on the fence and during the moments I feel okay and motivated I think I can do it but sometimes hours later I wouldn’t even be able to do simple tasks like brush my teeth or write an email. I am trying to fight my inner thoughts of feeling like a failure for not being able to complete the program as scheduled. I also fear the judgement from others as although I know this is not helpful I feel my depression and anxiety issues are not caused by a good enough reason. 

On one hand, the month off could be a really good time to get my routines, habits, and mental health better. However I also worry that the time off will put my into a deeper state of depression with more time on my hands to “do nothing”. I find the days I have to myself to rest and be productive are anything but that and I don’t trust myself being alone.

Depressed and Lonely,"Incident 1:
I was in a relationship with someone for 2 years whom I gave all my heart, attention and even left hanging out with my friends and stopped making new friends even. I wanted to travel with her, watch movies with her, and many other things but she refused for it all.
She left me for someone else and did all those things with her new boyfriend within 3-5 months of knowing him because she didn’t want to make the same mistake of saying “NO” to me.

Incident 2:
I lent a shoulder to cry on to a stranger girl on her breakup because I thought she didn’t have any friends but later on got to know that she didn’t want cry before anyone close to her. 
She used to talk with me for hours late in the night on how to get her boyfriend back. She never got her old relationship back but she did overcome her breakup and we became good friends. After a few months, when I went through my breakup, she didn’t comfort me in any manner whatsoever, but I ignored this fact and continued to be friends with her. After a while, I started to have a crush on her but then, she refused to date me. After a while, we finally got a chance to meet frequently but she just met me once and then found a new boyfriend and has stopped calling me ever since.

Incident 3:
I was in a relationship with a girl (whom I met in a wedding after which it was all online/virtual due to Covid) but then she left me and refused to meet me after the lockdown was lifted because she got to know that her ex was in 2 relationships when she was with him and also used to bring prostitutes to his house. Hearing this she got trust issues with me, so she left me.

Incident 4:
I lost my brother during Covid and went into clinical depression. I started questioning everything in life and was way too depressed to do anything. This incident broke me into pieces I can’t even count. But I did meet my father’s friend who is highly spiritual and showed me the path and I am immensely thankful for him.

Incident 5:
After being into clinical depression, I started popping pills for the same and when I thought of leaving the pills, when I was finally getting over it, I lost my job. I stayed positive, but then, I met with an accident because of which I became bed ridden for 15 days and at this point I was drained out physically, mentally and emotionally.

Current Situation: I feel very lonely, depressed and lost the will to live. I am having existential crisis and feel as if I didn’t sign up for this. Moreover, my ex (incident 1) is leading a very happy life with her new boyfriend and also got a promotion recently on her job. I feel like only bad things happen to good people.

How do I move forward in my situation?,"I’ve had a pretty large depressive episode the past 2 weeks. I’m in university and have skipped all my classes the past 2 weeks. I want to correct it and take action but at this pointy I’m almost too embarrassed to go back. It’s just been so hard mentally recently. This semester has been tougher than ever. I never have anything to look forward to. I have nobody to talk to. It’s so hard to gain enough energy to do anything. I will either have a tough time sleeping or sleep for very long periods.

I am a spoiled brat who deserves to rot,"I don’t even know what the point of this post is besides whining and bitching. Read at your own risk. 

I’ve had an extremely privileged life with good stable parents, living in a good neighborhood, attending a good school, and never had any sort of trauma. I have no cause but myself for being a piece of shit. 

I am ashamed of myself for at my core being a leech onto my family. For all I’ve been lucky to have, I still can’t get a hold of myself and get over my mood swings. I’ve constructed and trapped myself into a mask of happiness to present to my family and others. Whenever they ask how I’m doing, I only give them an answer of what they want to hear so they don’t need to think about my self inflicted  misery. Any slipup from my happy mask just causes more undue problems to my family. Anybody else in my life that claims to care doesn’t want to hear some brat bitching about nonsense when they have suffered way worse than me. I’ve consistently fantasized and had made plans about me just unexisting or being erased from my family and other people’s lives in some manner so at least they’d be left with a memory of my happy mask instead of dealing with my self inflicted bullshit.",AZ_fish,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12a90ng/i_am_a_spoiled_brat_who_deserves_to_rot/

I need advice…,"I’ve been really unhappy for a long time. Suicide at many points throughout. 

I’m in college now. I’m on ADHD medication and a part of that is a mild antidepressant (one of the side effects of the other medications is a lowered mood). They’ve helped me a lot of stay on top of my work and made me feel a lot better than I did before, but I’m still quite miserable.

Yesterday I tried shrooms. It was a low dose (recommended for first timers). I didn’t trip or feel euphoric or sweat or any of that stuff.
What did happen, is that for the first time in as long as I can remember, I felt good. I wasn’t anxious or self conscious and I didn’t overthink all my problems to the point of tears.

I got a change in perspective and suddenly I could see the problems in my life (not associated with the depression) clearly and I knew what to do about them.
I can’t prove that it wasn’t just me floating on the shroomies but I just feel it in my gut that that is what life was supposed to feel like.
Things weren’t great and I didn’t stop caring, but I could see a way forward and I had hope again. 

I want to talk to my psychiatrist about this but I’m not sure how. If there is any legal/sustainable/healthy way to feel like that again I need to try. I just can’t keep going on like this for the rest of my life.

Frustrated with persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) (rant),"Just really frustrated a life is really getting to me right now. Just got f-ed over at my job (HR demoted me because that's what they do to get a bigger Christmas bonus), got f-ed over at school (found out admin lied to me and now 3 classes I have taken don't count when I was told they would), and my relationships aren't great. I would love to take time off for myself and get my head on straight but thanks to being a FUNCTIONAL depressive, I can't qualify for any disability. I can still get up and go to work, I'm still passing classes, and I'm maintaining relationships, so it looks like I'm totally fine. I'm actually really falling apart on the inside however. I'm starting to shut off emotionally and I'm fast-tracking myself into a drinking problem.

The irony is I wish I was worse because then I could actually get help, but no, I have to be just functional enough on the outside to not fall under any qualifications for time off/disability.

If anyone has any tips for trying to handle this situation, I'm all ears. FYI, I'm not currently on med because they all give me side effects so bad that I end up depressed (the irony) and I'm not currently in therapy because I'm exhausted from trying to find a therapist that's worth the $1,000's that I pay them (I've been through several).

I've never cared about my future because I'm too weak to stand up to my parents.,"I never studied in school. I somehow got into university, I didn't study there either. I didn't care, I stopped going to class and didn't show up for some finals. I didn't see the point in trying. I wanted to go to grad school but I know my parents wont let me go anywhere. I had a scholarship for university and my parents said I wasn't allowed to move out so I didn't. I needed a safety net.

Somehow I graduated, after 6 years, with an embarrassingly low GPA. Now I have a job but I do the bare minimum. 

My parents are extremely religious and I'm an athiest. I'm queer too.

They've restricted my life and I can't argue because they pull the religion card and I can't say anything. I've never had friends because my parents always had problems with me talking to others. They picked ny university, my major, my job, everything. I'm not allowed to wear shorts for fucks sake.

I knew from a young age to never have dreams or goals because I know I can't have a life. I will have the life my parents pick. I accepted that a long time ago.

I know this all sounds pathetic but I'm just so exhausted, I can't fight back. I can't go against them.

I know I have a job decent savings and could move out but it would need to be in secret because I'm not allowed to move out until I'm married (to someone they pick) and logistically it seems like too much work. I also have no life skills or social skills so I wouldn't last long if I did escape.

Yeah my parents are shit but if I live with them I don't have to cook, clean or pay bills. I'm too exhausted to do those things.

I'm not allowed to get a driver's license or take the bus or uber so my mom drives me everywhere. Its pathetic so I dont go anywhere but work.

When I'm not at work I'm in bed scrolling through tiktok trying to make the time pass. Everyday is the same.

I'm going to die in my house. I've always know it. It's my fault for being so spineless and not fighting back.

I used to count on my partner but since I broke things off I have to deal with the broken pieces. I knew if I stayed things wouldn't have improved. I felt too worthless when they insinuated that I was replaceable. Or the countless times I felt like I was being treated like a joke. I tried to always deal with the brunt of not being enough.

I tried to do grand gestures  to show I wanted to make things up but at the end of the day I didn't feel like it mattered. To be honest, I'm in shambles.

My dad is losing his eyesight due to glaucoma and doctor said I have very high chances of getting it as I grow older. My mother also started to have some health issues and she can't even do normal chores in the house anymore. The good thing is I am healthy, for now. My father served in the army and has no properties or wealth whatsoever. While my grandparents have it all and they are refusing to give it to us. As they refuse, our relatives are taking advantage of it and taking up our properties one by one.  To which my father is getting furious. All these years my father spend his entire salary and time and everything on their parents and saved literally nothing, and now he gets nothing. He is a upset and depressed. He quit drinking 7 years ago, which he started drinking again when he had an argument with everyone in the house. He worked hard enough in his life and all he got was being shamed and being called names. He is a strong man, both physically and mentally. but he broke down eventually because of his parents. 

All we have is a small house which is on my mother's name and some gold jewellery which my mother owns. My father fought all these years so that he could get at least one property so that I can take a education loan on that, but it isn't seem to be happening anytime soon. My mother is preparing to sell the gold she owns and take a loan on our home for my education. Now since my parents health is deteriorating I don't know if this is the right time to leave them. they may not say this to me but they need me. and my dream was to complete the masters, always has been. I am confused...

We are currently living on my father's pension and my so called salary, which my contractor pays as he wishes. I would say I am in a better place than most, at least have a home and my parents. so this might not sound like depression for most. I am confused and all my thoughts are turning pitch black day by day.

 an old friend of my dad told me, your parents need you right now, more than ever. You should not turn your back on them. I forgot the fact that as I was growing up, they were growing old. This struck me. We have nothing to show for, if I am hospitalised right now, we don't have anything for the treatment or even the hospital charges to get me admitted. I want to break this cycle, I want to get a better job and get a better pay and want a better life for myself and my parents for the time they are with me.

But then my Dad got fired from his job, which meant that I had to share the TV and that meant less time to play video games. Months after that, he had to go to the hospital because we learned that he had heart failure. So now, he is home all day and does this hacking to clear phlegm, which triggers my Misophonia. Because of that, I'm not able to play video games anymore just to avoid it. My grandmother also click her teeth with her tounge after she eats something, which also triggers my Misophonia mostly.

I hate sharing things and my family have always said I was self-centered/selfish and that I only think about myself. People have treated me wrongly and I have treated some people wrongly too. I'm fat, pretty average to ugly (but I do have nice eyes, so I have been told), and no personality.

I don't want to say I have depression, but I do feel that I am depressed (I hope that makes sense and I am not trying to fake how I feel as some others do). Everyday, in between moments of joy, happiness, and pleasure, it's full of suffering, sadness, and most importantly, anger. I can't even fucking listen to my favorite FUCKING artist because they lick their FUCKING lips way too damn much and it really annoys me. Or even look at certain people because of their stupid corny ass mean mug/stone face.

And here I am, trying to muster up courage to talk to a girl tomorrow that was really nice to me in our few encounters that we had in 2 different classes. I'd just want to be her friend. Being her BF wouldn't be ideal tbh, although it would be nice as she seems really nice and she is REALLY beautiful to me. I literally even cried tears about if only I was an entirely different person that was attractive rather than......me, like 2 weeks ago.

Nothing will be better. The past 3 years, and by extension, my whole life has been horrible, with some good though. All-in-all, I just want peace. Peace is all I want, and wishing that I was someone else with an ideal life. Like waking up in a cabin with a beautiful song while it's sunrise with the love of my life. I'm not a victim as I know everyone goes through shit and everyone has problems, but my fucking problems are way too much and they aren't going anywhere anytime soon. I have no desire to change or improve my life with no motivation in this life. I'm too weird. I'm too me. Honestly, fuck people. Fuck everyone. But most importantly, fuck me.

Three things I have to accept.,"1.  I am not going to self-destruct, in spite of persistent and strong urges to do so.
2. That bad times lie ahead.  I will be incapacitated either by an accident, or an illness, or a combination of negative circumstances or by the decline that comes from ageing.
3. That my depression means that I am either in a hell, or on the path to the next one.  There is nothing else.
4. That when the end does come, if I am capable of thought at that time, I will reflect that I have always been a total twat.",simplesoul999,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12af7nx/three_things_i_have_to_accept/

I really need help,"This is my first time posting here so I hope it doesn't get drowned out in the sea of posts, and hopefully someone can see my situation from another perspective. 

Anyways, I (15M) have been in a huge slump as of late, and cannot for the life of me be bothered to do my homework or study for assessments. I have a huge assessment due in a couple days and am extremely behind, yet have no fucking motivation do jack at all. Like my mind keeps telling myself I need to do shit but my body physically can't. And when I finally do start doing something my mind just blanks and I either spend hours studying something stupid or just give up. 

I know I can't keep on going like this but holy shit is it a complete agony to try. Like my depressions not at its worst, yet my motivation has fallen further into the depths of hell. Like why the fuck should I study. I mean I can just always kms if things are too bad. The world's so fucking shit anyways, I'm just gonna end up working some ass job that I don't like. 

I don't have any really close friends though I'm trying my best. My fucking early teen years were the worst, I would SH and I caused stupid drama, and had like no friends and was super awkward. Now I'm socially anxious and find it hard to ask for help. My parents are kinda narcissistic assholes sometimes, though my situation is fine. Fuck no it's not really I lied.

At this point I'm just gonna monologue because I cannot be assed. I'm basically a disappointment. I know I can ""have a life ahead of me"" blah blah, but how the hell am I meant to do shit. Like I'm not too depressed but fuck why do i have to study for hours at home a day, also our education system is utter trash sometimes. 

I really need to find some source of motivation like right now. I don't really give a fuck about the future, nor do I have like good friendships or caring family. I don't have someone I like, or any reason to live except for myself. So that's what I've been doing, not giving a shit about anything really apart from myself. Just playing games, watching shows, eating trash, indulging in any form of cheap dopamine. I know the consequences and I know I'm gonna fail in life if I don't fucking pick myself up. Yet, I seem to have no reason at all to do so.

Alright I should probably stop there, it seems I've vented quite a lot. Really any advice would be nice man cuz I'm in a true slump.

"I feel like everybody absolutely hates to spend time with me. Which is valid, because so do I.","Honestly my life isnt going awful. Its actually good. The only thing I just cant seem to manage is having a social life. And Im so tired. I try to be friends with people, I find someone new, I hyperfocus on them, they get creeped out, they leave. Its the same cycle over and over again.

There is nothing more painful than that moment when you realize its happening again. Theyre losing interest. They stop asking you to do stuff with them, they make up excuses when you ask. You ask them if they dont want to talk to you and they say ""idk i just dont know what to say"". 

I know I shouldnt depend my own selfworth on other people's perception of me, but depression makes it so hard. Its dangerous and depressing to be alone but I have nowhere to go. 

All my friends seem to have this person who they know they could call and theyd show up within 10 minutes at their doorstep.

I still vividly remember my former therapist asking me ""so who do you call?"" And I was completely baffled. Id never ever even heard of friendships like that. I looked at her completely dumbfounded and went ""you know these kind of people only exist in movies, right?"". 

I just need to get all this off my chest. Im so exhausted. So tired. I dont want to be alone anymore. I dont want to feel like a burden.

Future Scare,"21M

Hey everyone. So... I happen to be coming here real early because for the past few days I've been rather uneasy.

I've been worrying for years now if in the future I will ever be able to buy a house within 5 or 6 years. I'm working full-time, I'm doing college online for software engineering, I also have $5K in the bank and no debt.

I'm scared for many factors that could destroy my life in the future, worried if my field will be automated or if a house in a really desired area I want or REALLY any area at all in fact will become unaffordable. I dont want to come up with $100K by 26 or 27 only to be told I don't have enough. 

I'm planning to start working overtime and my future plans could be in jeopardy and this is why I feel terrified.

Even if I am priced out can't I still rent a house and work remote doing software engineering? Please? I'm fucking terrified and I have been this way for months. It's caused me to feel depression thus I've been feeling slow and a little sick. This is what fear does, it depresses, and this depression I feel is ruining me.",Santa-Kruz,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12adpmu/future_scare/

I think the actual reason is a double-edged sword. We all can only view the world as we see it. Even if we empathize  with other others that's really just saying we understand that everyone experiences the world differently but in reality we are limited to how our brain perceives and feels things. So from my point of view, if I had a kid or even a friend who has felt the same way as me for this long, I would find that just as heartbreaking as losing them at the very least and I would truly understand why they no longer wanted to feel this way because I know how painful it is. So why is it better for your kid to keep trying to push on with such a broken heart?",hardstuckp2,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12abldk/question_for_parents/

I Just Don't Know How to Feel Happy Anymore,Everyday i wake up and just wish I never did. I try so hard to make everyone in my life happy but I just can't seem to. Someone is always upset with me in one way or another. Nothing I do is good enough. I smoke too much. I quit college. I distanced myself from my friends and I feel guilty bc of that. They have been friends with me for over 10 years but sometimes just texting back is hard. Just the thought of hanging out with them makes me nervous and I feel like a shitty friend. I think about them all the time but I never text them. Sometimes I get a bit upset bc they never text me and ask me if I'm okay. My other friend went through a similar experience when we were younger and we all made sure she was okay but now that it's me it doesn't matter. I don't matter. I have had vivid ideas of how I'm going to kill myself but I know I'll never do it bc I'm  too much of a coward. I just pray I get into a car accident so it can do the job for me.

Inspiring story on recovering from depression,"Once upon a time, there was a person who had been struggling for a very long time. They felt overwhelmed by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and exhaustion.

They had trouble finding joy in the things they used to love and had difficulty getting out of bed every morning. They felt stuck and seemingly unable to see a way out of their current state.

One day, this person decided that they were tired of feeling this way. They wanted to make a change. They sought help from a therapist and started attending regular sessions to work through their feelings and develop coping mechanisms. They also reached out to friends and family for support and started to open up about their struggles.

Over time, this person began noticing small improvements in their mood and energy levels. They started incorporating healthy habits into their routine, such as exercise, healthy eating, and getting enough sleep. *They also started to challenge negative thoughts and reframe them in a more positive light.*

Although there were still tough days, this person continued to persevere and make progress. They started to set very small goals for themselves and celebrated each accomplishment along the way. They also found comfort in creative outlets, such as writing and painting.

As time went on, this person began to feel more like themselves again. They were able to find joy in the things they used to love and felt much more connected to the world around them. They were grateful for all the support and love they received from those around them and were proud of the progress they had made.

While the journey to recovery was not easy, this person learned that it was possible to overcome depression with the right tools, attitude, and support. They found a renewed sense of hope and purpose and were grateful for the opportunity to live life fully again.",MusicalVibez,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/129xrs2/inspiring_story_on_recovering_from_depression/

Is this burnout or depression?,"So I already struggle with mental illness in my daily life (GAD, social anxiety, and depression). Over the past few months I've detected a steady decline in my mental health and I think it's really becoming life altering. Anxiety leaves school to be an incredibly draining and debilitating aspect of my life, so in the weeks leading up to spring break I would come home absolutely exhausted and then usually have to go to work afterwards.

I don't work a ton, but I do maintain around 12-15 hours per week while also trying to sustain decent grades (I'm a senior in high school for additional info). It was getting so bad that I would come home and sleep for hours on nights I didn't have to work.

My spring break started last Monday and I've noticed a complete attitude change in myself that I never used to struggle with in the past. For two days I did absolutely nothing. I didn't shower, I didn't practice hobbies, I didn't even get changed. I sat in bed literally all day long and watched shit on my phone. It was like I just had a complete mental crash. Writing this out makes me realize that this is probably pretty commonplace, but it's unusual for me because I literally just started neglecting everything I care about.

Therefore, that set the stage for how the rest of my break has been. I can't get out of bed, I can't clean my room, I can't shower. I literally just don't care. That's literally the only thought in my mind. I don't give a fuck. I try to get myself to do something and all that I can think is, ""Why should I?"" or ""Why does it matter?"". I can't get anything on track and I don't know what to do because I don't care about anything anymore. I don't even know if I ever had a drive or ambition to begin with, I think I was always just ""motivated"" by other people's expectations of me. Life feels too exhausting for me to even bother.

Edit\] I think it's worth noting that in this state that I've been in, it almost feels like I'm paralyzed. I LITERALLY cannot get myself to move. It quite literally feels impossible. Also, before spring break I would get mini sessions like this. I would go into states like I described and then usually fall sleep, waking up and wanting to cry because it would be 2 AM. My eating habits are jacked, sleep is all over the place, and I'm always emotionally unstable.",mysterycow2466,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12a58dh/is_this_burnout_or_depression/

It's my time. I want do die.,"Hello peeps,

I tried for a long time to hold off, thinking and hoping things will be get better. I listened to many, who will tell me how previous life is, and how there is always something to live for, to not ""do anything stupid"".

Living seemingly for others when really others don't care. the life of loneliness that never ever will go away.

I lost everything that was ever important, I was never able to make things work although my heart was in the right place. I tried, I truly did. I fail at everything, and I have no further need for hoping. I mean, why?  There's no point. I am in my mid 50's. Things don't get better. I am a true loser, I'm ugly as hell, no love in my life. 

I'm not a druggie, just a regular guy, but I was not fortunate to be able to get good things, things to live for. Every effort is just failure, and at this age and point, there just isn't a need anymore.

For the past 5 days, I have overdosed on my blood pressure medication and insulin. I have taken 15-20 pills of losartan, and also taken 100 units of my insulin. Yet all that happens is me waking up fatigued. 

Listen,  I want to die.  I'm no longer trying to find reasons to live. I don't want it. I can't seem to even get suicide attempts right. Already I am eyeing the door that maybe I can use for hanging.

It has to be done.  I don't want to end my day in constant mental pain and relive having nothing to live for, nothing to wake up to. 

If people think that suicide is a cowardice, or selfish, then I guess it is.  Hearing something like that might be more encouraging to do it.

I was upped in dosage to 300 XL this past Thursday and I’ve been feeling crappy! The first day didn’t really feel much. Friday nauseous and food aversion and insomnia. Saturday same.

Second guessing if I even need to keep trying to socialize.,"I'm only trying to remove myself from my socially isolated lifestyle because everyone says I should. Everyone says that's what I should want. But most importantly, I'm mentally unwell and everyone says mental illness is inevitable when you isolate yourself.

But is that really, definitively true? I feel I get plenty of socialization by going to the store and just walking among other people. I get it from watching videos online.

Most importantly, whenever I try to interact with others, I get the crippling pain of feeling out of place, and helpless to ever change that.

Every time I try, the pain resurfaces. I try to talk to others, I try to be myself, but I feel rejected. Then I try to be what I think they want, and I feel used. I see a therapist, and they challenge the way I think, but they can't change the way I feel. I try to exercise because they say mental health mirrors physical health, but the longer I stick to it, the heavier the lack of change in my self image weighs on me, until I stop.

I can't see any peace for me without locking myself away as much as I can. Is there really no happy ending possible that way?",kurnae,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/129ylpu/second_guessing_if_i_even_need_to_keep_trying_to/

It's Time For Me To Change (Day 0),"⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️ Trigger Warning ⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️
- talks about addiction 
- mental healfh


Well, life really isn't going that great for me, my life is a mess. I'm a nursing student year 1, I've got an addiction to opiods. They are controlling my life, every second of every day I'm thinking about them. No matter what I can't stop I'm so scared that this will cost me everything.

- no motivation to do anything, staying in bed most of the day
- very little sleep. Staying up all night until 7am then sleep till 10
- I've got a skin condition eczema, on the back of my ankle which bleed every day when I wear shoes.
- no appetite, today I have had 2 Yorkshire puddings. I just have this feeling that I don't want to eat. I love food it's worrying me

I am on antidepressants, they have changed my life. I dont feel the same as before when my mental health was bad, I don't think it's that.

So I have officially decided that I need to change, going down the path I am on, I am going to end up in hospital or worse

My plan is to focus on one thing at a time, my addiction is going to be the hardest thing to stop.
I am going to start going to Narcotics Anonymous meeting. Mainly online 

But first I need to tackle my motivation. So tomorrow I am getting up at 8 am I need to force myself to. Go to my dermatology appointment. Then i am not allowed I'm my bed until bed time 

Thats the first step for me

I wanted to write this on here to give me more motivation

Everything sucks and I'm tired.,"20 M

Broke up with my girlfriend who also used to be my best friend.

Mom diagnosed with a stage 2 breast cancer and she's the only bread winner of the family.

Dad's retired and brother doesn't have a job.

Not enough money at home.

Friends who are equally or even more depressed than I am.

Not enough motivation to get up in the morning and go to college anymore. No social energy, no motivation to upskill and get a job. Even typing this is causing me to use up the last bit of energy I have left for the day.

I'm leaning towards vices which I always stood against when I used to be a happy guy just a few years ago, like drinking and smoking to help me not think about any of this.

Crippling depression and loneliness,"I’ve been dealing with depression since I was about 11 years old when my parents divorced. It was extremely hard growing up in two households. Both parents constantly trying to prove themselves as the better parent which ultimately made them both toxic in my eyes. 

And now I am on the verge of age 28 this year. Single, no children, no real friends and the one that I do have lives in another state too expensive  for frequent visitation. I don’t even like being around my family. It is a blended family too which means some of my family members like to constantly remind me that we’re not truly family. I isolate myself ALOT. I can’t even go out anymore to the store or anything without comparing my life to others and breaking down into a panic attack.
I envy most people and social media has played a huge part in that aspect so I deleted all my accounts. I can’t even follow self help pages on instagram without feeling worthless and they’re supposed to help with that, right ?

I seriously do not enjoy the quality of my life and have even stopped caring about myself. I’ve gained weight and stopped wearing makeup and dressing nice. I no longer have any interest in dating since I have trust issues through the roof and the only way to protect myself is to avoid dating. 

There are some days however, that I feel my sanity kicks in and I realize what I’m doing with my life which is wasting away and self sabotaging. So I make plans to better myself, but then comes back the depressing feeling of “there is no point”.

The only honest thing keeping me around these days are my two fur babies. I’ve planned that once they both pass on, I will go with them. I hate that my life has come to this. It’s sad and I truly don’t like thinking or talking like that, but it’s how I feel.",_sapphiremoonlight_,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12a6b5a/crippling_depression_and_loneliness/

They never wanted me to date someone during my college days but I broke their trust. They never scolded me about it but instead they sort of understood my situation and tried make me feel that they were hurt because of my actions and I disappointed them. I let them down, their parenting, etc. 
Later, they found out about me smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol through an old friend of mine.

Idk where to post this so I decided to post it here. I fucking hate my life. I just can't anymore I only have one friend whom I trust but my parents forced us to stop talking so we are distant now, I've got no other friends to share my feelings with so I just store them so they compound. All close ppl do around me is criticize me either in the way I act or the way I talk or the way I dress. 

My relationship with my family is even worse I mean they took the only person I trusted and cared for enough they forced them out of my life bcz ""they know what's good for me"" and so they left me with their shit parenting. I tried talking things out but they never fucking listen and I even asked them last year if I can go to therapy bcz I had suspected I have ADHD (still think I have it) my mom flat out said no she gave me a whole lecture on how she did the tests and shit when I was younger and agreed she'd take me to therapy but whenever I asked she'd gaslight me into thinking I was wrong and she was right.

The only and I mean only thing I look forward to is marriage since I love kids and would love to give them a better life and be a better parent than my parents. And to fucking feel loved I wanna be able to fuck up sometimes and not get criticized or reviece a lecture I want someone to finally have my fucking back.

I also have a recital coming up this month that I'm ill prepared for. And my grandmother, who is basically senile, is coming to stay with us in a couple weeks for an undetermined amount of time. She's bringing her two dogs with her, so now there's going to be four dogs I have to care for, plus a mentally deteriorating grandmother with a lot of needs.

Her family doesn't really support her, they even know how She feels, but they don't take it serious or just do not care, since they treat her miserably most of the time.

I asked her to seek professional help, but She doesn't want too and even if I ask propose to go with her, She just doesn't want too. She doesn't see any sense in life &amp; everytime I try to show her what Life can be, everything seems good for the moment, but then everything starts over again. She once didn't even sleep till 5 a.m, because She was scared to be ""alone"". Sometimes it seems like She's scared of dieing, sometimes it seems like dieing is the only thing that can give her peace..

Should I talk to her about these things, even if She doesn't want too, or do I just show her how life can be, with the hope that She won't do anything? I really can't afford to lose her, She's often the only reason why I can laugh at some tough days..",ExcitedStepdad,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/129ximn/my_best_friend_doesnt_want_to_live_anymore_i_cant/
Don't know where to go from here (vent),"Sorry for the long post I just needed to vent a little. (22M) I've struggled with depression and my generalized anxiety disorder for as long as I can remember, growing up I went through daily physical and emotional abuse and in high school I allowed myself to be emotionally abused and manipulated in relationships. I've always had zero confidence or self worth and feel empty and anxious constantly, my mind is always filled with negative thoughts about myself. About a year ago after breaking up with my girlfriend of 5 years I decided to try to change myself for the better after hitting my lowest point. I've done everything I can think of to improve my life; I lost nearly 100 pounds, started weight training consistently, dove into my hobbies, bought my dream car, started saying yes to every social invitation, finished my degree, recently applied to grad school to pursue my dream career, tried therapy and started to take medication to improve my mental health. Despite this on a good day I just derealize or disassociate, and on bad days its like I am in a constant state of panic and my mind is always racing with negative thoughts about myself and my life. On top of this I recently moved cities for work and have no local friends nor the ability to make friends. I can't even make eye contact with strangers and I am always on edge when there is no reason to be. With all the friends I do have I don't seem to have the ability to open up or let them know anything about me. I always keep conversations surface level and redirect any topics about myself. I tend to try to seem self-reliant and put together publicly but in reality I feel emptier, lonelier, and more depressed than ever. I try to distract my mind by keeping busy all the time, but as soon as I inevitably sit down and have any time to think at all my mind sinks into despair. Not sure where to go from here, while the meds have improved my motivation (a simple task like washing the dishes or going to class would drain me, I couldn't even get out of bed most days) every other aspect of my mental health seems the same. Just feeling afraid that this is what the rest of my life is going to look like and while I manage to push through every day its exhausting.",Sufficient_Ad_8370,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12a3q44/dont_know_where_to_go_from_here_vent/

"Medication changes, worsened mood swings and could use some support.","So this is not about me (31M) but my GF (29F). She has been battling depression on and off for a good portion of her adult life and seems to be going through a bad patch lately. She has been perscribed adderall for a few years for ADD and hasnt been taking any other meds, but has had a therepist and psychiatrist she has been working with. As of January 2023, she lost both of them due to an insurence change with her work. Its been very hard. We've tried getting her support and she has found a psychiatrist recently and they dont want her to continue the adderall. She also suggested an antidepressant and my GF has always considered, but is hesitant. She finally agreed to try bupropion since she had it in the past and likes the idea of maybe having it mitigate the dopamine changes that may come with coming off adderall and the lack of weight gain side effects. However, she is only on day two and she is losing her mind. She is very unstable right now and I've tried to be there for her and explain how hard it is to drop one med and that there will be mood changes and energy changes, and also that new meds take time time to balance out. But the mood swings she is having right now are some of the worst ive seen her have. They seem to me to be more of a result of stopping adderall than anything else, but I just dont know. I'm not sure how to support her best. She is saying she is giving up on everything and just cant do anything at all. No work, no focusing on anything is possible, says she is sorry but she needs to break up with me because she is so mentally ill and so on and so forth. I know she is struggling and i know its hard to stop and switch meds, and im really trying to be here for her while working full time, but she loses herself when she is home alone, like today. 

Is there any advice or ideas out there as to how i can help her? I feel hesitant to bring her to a hospital, but idk if that's maybe a good idea? I let her parents know and they're helping me/her today while im at work, but im still kinda freaked out and unsure about what to do.

Im a stranger,"Im a 19M and i've had on and off depression for the last 5 years with really bad depression the last 2 years since i started studying in uni.

I literally feel like the biggest loser in the world because im turning 20 and i have nothing to show for it.. i have never had any intimate relationship with anybody and I have pushed all my family away and all my friends away and I iterally have nobody in my life that gives a shit about me anymore and its all my doing aswell.

I feel even worse because everybody says ""uni will be the best time of your life"" , but my experience has been the most emotionally harrowing and isolating experience of my life and I feel like I might go insane.  

I started uni in an already bad mental state thinking it would be a fresh start where i could thrive and find myself. But it has been the polar opposite; I immediatly found myself stranded in endless amounts of uni work and after the first few weeks I didnt have any time to go out and isolated myself completely, just studying day in day out just to pass. I quickly realised that I seemed to be the only one finding it so hard and it really started to get to me. The other classmates I had that I tried to connect with were quite reserved and didn't really engage too much but come the end of  year and everybody was out of their shells and found their cliques. It really made me self concious alot and mentally I became more reserved and i started to feel extremely depressed with my parents also giving me alot of resistance from switching degrees and slowly distancing themselves aswell.

During this time i'd still go out with my roomate occasionally since we were friends from school and we lived together so he'd ask me to tag along(out of sympathy). And honestly he was my only support structure. Its sad because the feeling was most definately not mutual.. but he was the only thing keeping me sane while my life was falling apart.

Last week he broke the news to me that hes gonna be moving countries within the next month so im basically gonna be staying all alone in our apartment the rest of the year, and it very much got to me. It was then that id realise that after my roomate leaves there wont be anybody on this planet that gives a shit about me. Im literally just rotting away alone in an apartment studying day in and day out.. with nobody to call and vent to, no texts asking how ive been ,not a single notification, basically not existing on this planet. I just cry and work and repeat just wanting something as simple as a hug or some agknowledgement that i still exist or mean something to this world. But im struggling to find a reason why im still going and im just tired.

"I've developed a disturbing symptom that is freaking me, my friends and family out. What is it called and how do I resolve it?","I have been depressed for quite some time but haven't done anything about it, but intending to see my GP tomorrow. I also suspect that the depression is caused by undiagnosed ADHD which I will also mention tomorrow.

Recently I have been very very stressed and have developed a weird phenomenon whereby anytime I cringe internally at a past event or have an intrusive thought or generally feel down about myself, I will shout something out loud. Usually taboo words or phrases, but sometimes something mundane like ""I need money"" (I don't have any money issues). The shouting is really loud and it seems to serve as some sort of way to not engage with the thought I am having. To try to push it out of my head.

1) what is this called? 

2)how should I approach my doctor about this? 

3) what therapy is available to treat and can I treat this myself?

Should I Let Him Go,"Hi Everyone- I want to start by saying I am not looking for medical advice and yes I have a therapist I speak with.

I would love some outside perspectives on this.

I am a woman in my mid twenties and I have a very severe dissociative disorder and depression. Back in November, I was able to break out of the dissociation as I planned a trip to visit my boyfriend who is in another country. We had a great time and since then I have traveled back and forth to spend time with him, with little to no dissociation.

A month ago, unfortunately, I have fallen back into a dissociative state and I know what triggered it. I have not been able to pull out of it, even with another trip planned to see him in a month. I am barely functional. This has been beyond heartbreaking for me as I was so happy to be functional and active for the last 4 months. I am back to being more or less bedridden.

My boyfriend is aware of my history with this. Up until now, I have not told him that I have fallen back as I thought perhaps I could move through it and I did not want to worry him unnecessarily.

I do not know if I should break it off with him. I wonder if it's the best idea for him, or if I am sabotaging it. I don't know. He is, quite literally, the light of my life, and to loose him would be a fatal blow to me. He has been my rock for the past 2 years. It is because I love him that I am contemplating breaking it off. I am crying writing this. I am not functional and I just think he needs someone who is stable.

Tl;DR: I lapsed back into a dissociative disorder, am back to not being functional, and want to know if I should break it off with my boyfriend because of it",[deleted],2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/12a1wyu/should_i_let_him_go/
Lacking real connections,"I  find it difficult to connect with people. I am very very sick both  physically and mentally and I've had a very hard life, and my reality  and struggles...

I can speak to people, but I end up feeling so much worse than before.

Today I invited over a guy I met at a language exchange, and I regret it so much.

Like, I didn't like the guy after a short conversation. He could've been worse, but.

When I met him he seemed alright, but then, he wasn't.

I  don't find people which whom I hit it off, I find myself comfortable, I  feel I can talk and share, I don't feel judged, I feel safe. I feel  understood.

I’m sick of hearing “it’s not your fault”,"tl,dr: thinking that I couldn’t have done anything to prevent my situation implies to me, that I couldn’t prevent it from happening in the future either.

I’ve been struggling with depression for a while now, or at least I think I am, haven’t been diagnosed yet, currently struggling to get a hold of a psychotherapist. I sometimes try to talk to some friends about my feelings, cause it’s supposed to help (honestly doesn’t really do it for me, as I’m struggling to even articulate what my problems are) and one thing that they’ve said, probably all of them at least once, is something along the lines of “I’m so sorry you feel like that, but it is important that you know, that it isn’t your fault, that you’re in this situation”.

And I get it (at least I think i do). When I searched this sub before posting, to see if this has been talked about before I found a lot of posts of people who are extremely burdened about feeling responsible for feeling awful and it is important to take that off them as a step towards feeling better. 

But to me, hearing again and again, that it is “not my fault” sounds so depressing, because it seems to imply that I had nothing to say about me feeling the way I do. And I don’t really know, how I would be responsible for my situation, but that’s fucking awful. If there was nothing that I could have done to prevent my situation how do I know that if I get better I won’t be in the same place again some time further down the road? It means that I have no way of controlling my path and if nature decides in 10 years, that I should suffer again, so be it. Ain’t my fault. Thank god.

Is there something wrong with this? Am I making a mistake in my conclusion? Or is it just that fucked?

PS: reading this again, I guess you could see this as a way of me blaming myself and justifying it, but I don’t think it is. I genuinely find it depressing to think of the implications of “it’s not your fault”. But then again why would I know, maybe it’s an subconscious coping mechanism and I’m just lying to myself.",ConfidentAd5482,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/129useh/im_sick_of_hearing_its_not_your_fault/
Lonely depressed all of the above.,So idk how to really put this. I beat off a 12 year heroin/ opiate/benzo addiction and now I moved states about a year ago. Still don’t have a single friend. Still can’t even get my head straight when I wake up in the morning. Constantly worrying about my mom who has cancer. Constantly thinking about gettin high because I still can’t. Get those intrusive thoughts away. I just idk it at the end of my rope. Literally maybe later..  but anyway. Idk how to cope I grew up in a family where talking about problems was a no no. I understand why because my mom was a counselor/therapist/ psychologist and didn’t wanna bring work home with her I don’t blame her at all. I raised my siblings due to my other parents addiction. And now only one of them even will have anything to do with me. The only people I had to count on are more than 1200 miles away and I make min wage part time employed and partial unemployment and cannot afford to go see them and I HATE phone calls you cannot convey genuine emotion thru a phone. You just can’t. Facial expressions are about 70-80% of how we communicate as humans. And a phone call or text don’t do that. So that’s no good. Tried counseling tried therapy all that. I’m on a Suboxone MAT program and so I have to get counseling and therapy and stuff every week or I lose my meds. Also I’m now freaking dependent on a different substance just one from a doctor that takes a lot longer to come off of than the heroin I was on. So that’s dope. It’s destroying my teeth.

Lonely,"Im 26f. I live at home with my family. I’m divorced and I have a five year old. My marriage was all kinds of bad. My ex did things that really hurt me. But what keeps me up at night are the things I said and did to him. And that I might be everything he says I am. He dedicates all his forms of social media to bash me. I can’t have a bad day. Daily he’ll post our private conversations along with his commentary on what a bitch I am. Most of these conversations aren’t bad. Just the overwhelming violation of privacy. I can’t ask simple questions about my child without hundreds of others seeing it. It’s hard to explain. At home I have no sense of privacy. My parents are set that I smoke weed when I have never touched it.they read my journals which has made me no longer have one. I work really hard for my 5 year old. And I love her so much. I get up everyday at 3:30 am and god I’m so tired at times but I’ve built my life around her. To spend the most time I can with her. After 10hr shifts I pick her up and we do homework, etc.  And she hates me. She no longer kisses me, and will throw tantrums at me. Hit me. Everyday she asks about going with her dad.

I am just tired to fight.,"I posted the same on other subReddits too. It’s just a rant. 

It wasn’t a big thing for me to say no to it. I used to go to university. Work. I was busy. I had a healthy exposure to porn(if that is even a thing). Like interest was there. But it was no addictive. 
Now for last few years, larger plan did not worked out. Peers are cruising ahead with their lives. And here I am just being deserted by someone or something. Now porn doesn’t excite me no more. Nor for many things other. But I still jerk off. I tried to look for the porn clips that I watched in teenage years. It wasn’t same. It was just my desperate attempt to cherish the days that are gone. Fapping is now like a chore. Have nothing to do, go fap. I also want you to know that there were few weeks that I had to be busy and I was just functioning like healthy being. No porn. Nothing. So it isn’t like I am addicted to it. 
I am just bored or tired I guess. Life hit at me so many times. I never sought to write on social media before. Never sought for empathy. Rather I would help others. Hype them up, even on this subReddit. For even 2 day streak. Now I am tired to fight back. I just carried on thinking reprieve is around the corner. I had breathing spaces. But never a happy streak. I worked out. I played outdoor games. I used to draw. I used to play video games. I used to love someone. I used to write stories. I was the last resort for people in my circle when everything fell apart. Now, everyone is doing good so they are gone. I still have good friends. Few of them. But none in my state anymore. 
I don’t even know if anyone would look for this. It’s like almost everyone’s story. Nothing unique in rant here. I am not even looking that this will help. I used every trick. I succeeded most of times. But life happened, every time. 

Now I am just tired. 
Now I am just existing through days.

Running out of Patience,"Hi there. I don't have a way of venting or fully expressing myself so here where I can be anonymous is probably best. 

I lead two separate lives. I have a happy, positive attitude in front of friends and family, colleagues included. This is all a facade however, and despite the mental strain it puts on me I have to keep it up otherwise I just end up causing trouble. 

In my private time, I'm the opposite. I'm struggling to find reason for existing. I've been clean for 3 months yet the temptations are stronger than ever, I need some form of release or catharsis, and I can't seem to find it. I feel like my emotions are overflowing, and they're going to make my work life hell. I've already had god knows how many days off work and yet I'm on probation. I don't want to have to go back to job hunting, that was painful enough in itself. 

To add to this, I suffer from anxiety and ocd. I have a particular set of habits that I've developed due to my OCD, and fighting them everyday wears me down more. I feel like the fight was lost before it even begun. 

I am currently seeking counselling, but I am doubtful that is even working, considering I tell my counsellor I feel better each week, which I clearly don't, otherwise I wouldn't be venting here. 

To add to the stress and worry, I'm a single guy and I haven't been in a relationship for 6 years. Let's just say my only relationship was an abusive one, and it has left me scarred. I finally found the courage to open up recently and start trying to date again, yet to no avail. I was almost catfished recently, and that combined with being ghosted by people has left me wishing I hadn't come out of my shell at all. 

Yeah I get that I trust people and I can be gullible, but I just feel betrayed. I don't want to be abused and hurt again, I just want to be happy. I just want to see one shred of normalcy in at least one thing I do. 

It's tiring. I want to give up, but I'm too much of a coward to do anything life-ending. 

At the rate things are going, I feel like I'm a Masochist putting myself through all this extra pain and stress. 

Thanks for listening.",Sieregii,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/129qyaf/running_out_of_patience/
"All over again, but not exactly.","Hello, people.I'm a 25-year old agender person from Brazil.I have a long history evolving relationships to which I would completely use my energy in order to fulfill whatever my ex-lovers wanted to.

Lately I got evolved in a short-term relationship with a psychotic-schizophrenic-depressed person, the thing is i liked and loved her a freaking lot, but she was making me be her caretaker or something like that. I work 13h a day 6 day per week, I wasn't even having time to see my friends or family.

Yesterday we broke up. It was awful, as it always is but a little worse. Now she's sending me e-mails trying to blame me cause i warned her  support base people that something bad could happen.

So I tried to get over it, I invited my sister to go out with me and my friends and it was like one of the best days of my life.When I got home i started feeling extremely suicidal and about to do stuff. I asked for help but I ended up taking so much klonopin that i just nodded off. And then chaos was stablished. People I was talking to for help got despaired. And ever since I'm feeling very guilty cause I wasn't able to stay awake and these people had to go though this horrible feeling of when someone you love is in a high-risk situation.

But in the last few weeks, those times have gotten worse, almost always quite suicidal and I  am so scared all the time that something bad will happen. I can't help myself in these situations, and they have led to fights with friends and family. I had anger issues but they were basically completely gone until I started feeling this way. I am so scared I am going to fuck up my and other peoples lives because of this. I am also incapable of starting new friendships without the other person doing all the approaching, and I don't know how to find comfort anymore, especially when fighting with the people I would confide in.

"Knock knock, let me in","It's cold out here and my jacket isn't thick enough. I am trekking along these lines each one of us goes through in life and it seems more difficult for others but we all share that same experience at one point in our lives where our parents just- it's the end of their life. Someone was a father/mother figure in each of our lives and impacted us like we never knew before... 

In my case.. Losing both my father and mother. Losing a parent/parental figure in our lives seems to be a very common challenge... at least I like to think so..

One of my parents is alive still but is very sick and it's probably a matter of years before they go. I am not ready for it. Already lost one parent and it has only been two years since then. Being the baby of the family isn't really anything special as some people like to think. We stand at the end of an old marriage couple who had a kid late, had a kid and decided that was it, etc and we endure what is to come when we are just figuring out who we truly are in this life and who we are to ourselves, most importantly. 

I've been depressed for a month now. I haven't worked even though it's literally ONE phone call away. I haven't done much to improve on any hobbies I enjoy and life outside just TERRIFIES me. Especially now when it's just me. It just makes me a nervous wreck. I want to go out, exercise, feel the sun on my skin but... outside just feels like too much worry and fear for me to even attempt. Therapy, support from close friends helps but.. you know.. it's always a process and there is no deadline..

I had more confidence when my parent was alive but when they left, I was torn to pieces. Now, the idea of losing another and I still don't have my shit together?

I think I'm in love with it. Feeling better somehow feels worse. This week I could move and think again. I decided to give my pet rabbit away, I think I did it as punishment. I don't want to try, I don't want to care. I want to be alone and to never see anyone again. I told my therapist this and we agreed to end our sessions there. I just want it to get worse, to be certain of a choice and do as im told.

I'm stuck living in the abstract. I want something actual and concrete, wholeness like in objects; statues and monuments.

I made a big mistake in many ways and I am dying over it. This is going to sound stupid and horrible so please bare with me. My wife was away and I cheated on her - not in the traditional way, but I still did. I've been a completely straight shot my entire life and was always a little curious if I liked guys. I never had the chance in youth to explore and so I did tried sexting with some random guys online. I intended to just text but one thing led to another and I ended up doing more than that...
Being careless and in the moment, I accidentally showed my face in some parts of the videos I sent. One of the guys seemed... a little too forceful and manipulative, but I fell for it.

I'm doing a welding course, 680h, probably work as a welder which I actually like. But this depression is not new for me, I've carried it all my life, I feel like whatever I do is to keep worse to come at bay. Worse yet, whatever I do is not for myself but for my family and the espectations they have on me.

In reality I want to end everything, I don't want to participate in this society. I just want to sleep forever... But I'm a coward, I'm also smart enough to know that ending my suffering will only cause more to the people still here.

I was advised to taper off, but honestly I just couldn't stand the idea of taking it anymore. I built such a unhealthy relationship with it that I couldn't fathom the idea of taking it again. So I just quit cold turkey, and honestly it's been kinda crazy. Yesterday was my first day off, and nothing crazy happened other than light dizziness. What's weird is when I went outside, I stared at the beauty of the world around me, which wow I haven't done in forever.

I could remember so many things that happened in them, which is unnormal for me after waking up. Plus I just feel so drunk right.

I looked up SSRI withdrawal symptoms online, but there wasn't that much information on the positive side effects on it. I was wondering if anyone has experienced what I'm going through right now.

Should I quit my job?,"I’m 21 years old and I live with my parents in the UK. I currently work a part time retail job 16 hours a week. I currently have an ongoing health issue for almost 3 years which requires me to lose loads of weight and potentially get surgery to fix it. I have a surgeon appointment booked for this November. I’m currently losing weight and gradually getting to my target whilst waiting on this appointment.

The health condition has physically and mentally affected me in a very negative way. I’m not happy with my life at all, I feel horrible.

I’m constantly depressed, I’m not happy and surely my coworkers can sense this as well. I was also meant to go to University a few years ago but due to this health condition I didn’t go.

i dropped it for a second and some taller kid grabbed it and teased me with it. then eventually he just threw it across the gym so i would have to chase after. i feel like no one cares about me but me. this leads to mischievous acts in retaliation which lead to me getting in trouble. please help",Slingshotsharpshootr,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/129mqjm/i_am_almost_never_happy/
"cringe post from cringe me, i would enjoy some advice","so i failed 2 classes and im trying to save the rest of them. i am an international student in Canada. each course costs 2k. i barely have money to pay for everything when i dont fail shit. yes i am unresponsible, stupid and deserve to get shat on for failing those classes. i relapsed in bulimia and isolate myself, agrophobia depressed all that cringe shit, i am having it. since i am not american, i cant apply for a loan. if i dont declare my major in the May of next year i would need to pay for another full year. this is financially impossible. so i need to take summer courses. so far due to part time work i got this second term i can pay for 1 course. but i cant for the other. so i am still behind. and i am still struggling for other classes. after for being completely agorophobic and stupid for 3 months fixing everything within a month is difficult.

so my question is should i kill myself? and no i cant pay for therapy i was barely holding on before the relapse and bulimia only tore a whole in my wallet. i mean what can i do now? let alone the career field im 'pursuin' with my parents encouragment only makes me more depressed for the future. even if the class related to my potential major is my best class, i have no joy. should i die. i can go to this highway overpass. goddamnit. this is awful digital footprint. its all my fault. im not posting this on my uni subreddit cuz last time i vented and said i wanted to be admitted to er to get some meds to ease my anxiety they told me i was the most awful person ever. so i have nowhere. i know im cringe im sorry.

But theres nothing i can do.

Really doesn’t help,"

When your main problem with bpd is thinking people hate you and then all your friends have multiple parties and don’t even tell you let alone invite you, they don’t ever message you first and take days to reply when you text first and your ex keeps coming in and out and saying how sorry they are and then not messaging you for two weeks. 

I genuinely haven’t felt like this in years, I fully relapsed into drinking every day again. 
If I’m not drunk I’m high and I’m about ten minutes away from self harm relapse and pretty fucking close to trying to kill myself again. 

I thought the worst pain was having no friends but it’s not it’s thinking you have them then realising you mean absolutely nothing to them.

I met with my old classmate yesterday. He said he wanted to quit his job and apply to med school. I feel bad for him. I wish I can trade my life with him. He seemed so passionate about medicine, yet I dread every morning for going to work.

How did your depression start?,"For the last month something’s really off with me.

First of all, I’ve been feeling such a lack of motivation, especially when it comes to my studies. For comparison, last year I was the type of person who would do additional reading and know I struggle to do mandatory reading, even though I find the topics interesting. I will also start studying with some motivation, however after 15-30 minutes I will lose it. However, this is not just a studies problem. I’ve been going out with my friends, but I don’t feel eager to do that as I used to (I’m generally a big extrovert, that’s the thing). I also finally have the time to see all my friends because my exams are over, yet I just don’t feel like it.

Also, I’m having trouble focusing. Whenever I read something, I literally just scan the text, however the text just doesn’t reach my brain and every single sound can interrupt me and I have to re-read the paragraph.

And I’ve been feeling so alone and irritable. I don’t think I have to elaborate on this one.

Could this be start of depression or is it just a passing mood? Because I really don’t want to feel like this anymore.",postmeloneyy,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/129fdra/how_did_your_depression_start/

however, i cannot do ANYTHING without the idea of nihilism in the back of my mind, because i know anything i am doing will truly not matter in the end and it is extremely hard to get out of this mindset because it is simply true. 

i believe everyone should create their own meaning in life. i am young &amp; i know i have so much more life to live, but i just don’t see the reason. i noticed this truly started to take my life over whenever i did things i enjoy and i would still feel this way. my distractions no longer work as this idea is locked in my brain. 

some people see nothing but death and disillusionment and i am one of those people. people in this mindset believe that whatever they do ultimately doesn't matter because we'll all be dead sooner rather than later.

January 25, 2023 marked the 15th anniversary of r/AskReddit as community and to celebrate that milestone, along with hitting *40 million subscribers*, we are having special charity fundraiser!

Earlier this year, we asked the community to [help us design a T-shirt](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/10lfd5w/askreddits_15th_anniversary_tshirt_design_contest/) to sell during this fundraiser, with **100% of the proceeds going to charity**. We had a lot of great submissions and whittled it down to the top 5, which we [put to a vote](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11dr66a/announcement_please_vote_for_askreddits_15th/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) and the winner was the design featured at the top of this post called “AskReddit Hotline” by /u/Pleasant-Safe-8135, so congratulations to them! It was a close vote, so we decided to use the 2nd place design, [""What should I name this design? [serious]](https://imgur.com/a/K2BuS1s) by u/magicalgirldittochan  for a tote bag, to keep the eco-friendly theme considering The Rainforest Trust, was the charity [the community voted to support.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/11kyi0b/which_one_of_these_charities_should_askreddit/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Trump’s unprecedented felony charges bring up murky constitutional questions — like what happens if he wins another term while facing or serving a prison sentence. We’re political and legal reporters at POLITICO covering the case. Ask us anything.,"Trump is the first former or current president to ever be criminally charged, thrusting the U.S. onto uncharted and uncertain legal and political ground. The indictment is sure to cloud Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign and triggers a number of unprecedented scenarios. For example:

- Trump, [who pleaded not guilty](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/04/trump-surrenders-00090361) in an alleged hush money payments scheme, could face the possibility of campaigning for the White House while undergoing a criminal trial. 

- If he were to win a second term while facing or serving a prison sentence, it would give rise to a host of constitutional concerns.

All 34 felony charges against him are identical, with each carrying the possibility of up to four years in prison. However, judges rarely sentence defendants to jail for such offenses.

Let’s discuss – ask us anything. 

More about our reporters (and some relevant reading): 

[Erica Orden](https://twitter.com/eorden?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) is POLITICO’s legal reporter based in New York and was [in the courtroom yesterday](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/04/trump-surrenders-00090361) when Trump was arraigned. She’s covered the actions of Manhattan’s District Attorney as well as the many challenges Trump faces in state courts. She also covered the Michael Cohen case and other Trump-related matters in New York federal court.

[Josh Gerstein](https://twitter.com/joshgerstein) is POLITICO’s senior legal affairs reporter who broke down the [details from the groundbreaking court filings](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/04/trump-indictment-takeaways-analysis-00089988) that could make or break the case of People v. Donald J. Trump. Josh has covered the intersection of law and politics for more than a decade and was one of the two reporters who broke the story on the [Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473) last year.

[Meridith McGraw](https://twitter.com/meridithmcgraw) is POLITICO’s national political correspondent and was at Mar-a-Lago last night at Trump’s rally, which she reported [felt like a MAGA movie set](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/04/04/trump-campaign-arraingment-00090515). She has traveled across the country reporting on Donald Trump as well as the GOP and Democratic landscape, and has chased lawmakers up and down the halls of Congress seeking answers to important questions of the day.

Reddit Submission: [Psychedelics temporarily disrupt the functional organization of the brain, resulting in increased “perceptual bandwidth,” finds a new study of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying psychedelic-induced entropy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/m5aujy/psychedelics_temporarily_disrupt_the_functional/)

The article [""A mechanistic model of the neural entropy increase elicited by psychedelic drugs""](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-74060-6) has [been retracted](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-20093-y) from *Scientific Reports* as of September 15, 2022. Following publication, a typo was discovered in a processing script used to calculate the differential entropy, therefore invalidating the neural entropy estimates presented in the article. Since the results no longer supported the conclusions of the study, the Authors requested the article be retracted.

Please do not submit anything like that.

**We are taking this opportunity to have a discussion with the community. What are we doing right or wrong? How could we make** [r/science](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/) **better? Ask us anything!**

Further, if you've completed a degree, consider getting flair in [r/science](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/) through our **Science Verified User Program.**

[r/science](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/) has a a system of verifying accounts for commenting, enabling trained scientists, doctors and engineers to make credible comments in [r/science](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/) . The intent of this program is to enable the general public to distinguish between an educated opinion and a random comment without a background related to the topic.

What flair is available?

All of the standard science disciplines would be represented, matching those in the sidebar. However, to better inform the public, the level of education is displayed in the flair too. For example, a Professor of Biology is tagged as such (Professor | Biology), while a graduate student of biology is tagged as ""Grad Student | Biology."" Nurses would be tagged differently than doctors, etc...

We give flair for engineering, **social sciences**, natural sciences and even, on occasion, music. It's your flair, if you finished a degree in something and you can offer some proof, we'll consider it.

The general format is:

Level of education | Field | Specialty or Subfield (optional)

When applying for a flair, please inform us on what you want it to say.

How does one obtain flair?

First, have a college degree or higher.

Next, send an email with your information to [redditscienceflair@gmail.com](mailto:redditscienceflair@gmail.com) with information that establishes your claim. This can be a photo of your diploma or course registration, a business card, a verifiable email address, or some other identification. Please include the following information:

Username:

Flair text: Degree level | Degree area | Specialty

Flair class:

for example:

Username: PHealthy, Flair text:  Grad Student|MPH|Epidemiology|Disease Dynamics , Flair Class: epi

Due to limitations of time (mods are volunteers) it may take a few days for you flair to be assigned (we're working on it!).

*This email address is restricted access, and only mods which actively assign user flair may log in. All information will be kept in confidence and not released to the public under any circumstances. Your email will then be deleted after verification, leaving no record. For added security, you may submit an imgur link and then delete it after verification.*

**Remember, that within the proof, you must tie your account name to the information in the picture (for example, have your username written on a slip of paper and visible in the photo).**

What is expected of a verified account?

We expect a higher level of conduct than a non-verified account, if another user makes inappropriate comments they should report them to the mods who will take appropriate action.

"Question for programmers of blockchain regarding legal solutions to IP controversy of generative AI (Stablevision, Midjourney, etc)","Hi! I am writing a paper on the intellectual property Wild West we are facing right now. I found this article about blockchain being a solution. Can you elaborate? 

I know this cannot help these artists retroactively, but I assume these training databases will be updated in the future, especially after courts answer questions about fair use/derivative works. 

For some background on why this is controversial— Scrapping the web for human works and copying those works in order to develop new tools that benefit the public has been held to be fair use. 

For example, in the Perfect 10 case, Google scrapping the web and copying images for image search engine was fair use because they were low resolution thumbnails and because it made a new functional tool that benefited public). Another example—in the Sega case, Accolade reverse engineered and thus copied Sega’s computer program in order to make the object code readable and so they could learn how to make new games for the Genesis console. This reverse engineering was also held to be fair use (they were not a licensee of Sega) because the disassembly of the Sega’s product was the only reasonably available means for obtaining the unprotected functional codes of the their game program. 

Fair use is a four part test which includes an analysis about derivatives works and impact on the market for their original works. 

A big question in these cases is whether the work is transformative (adds something new, with new meaning or function) and how it impacts the market for the original work, or derivatives of that original work. This will be difficult because the outputs vary depending on human prompting—they made a tool, but not sure if they are legally responsible for the outputs since they are jointly owned (or maybe not copyrightable at all). 

That was just background, here is my main question—-

(1) Curious to know what some of you think about how this sort of algorithmic training model is different from what search engines were doing?  

(2) In terms of block chain—I have little knowledge of how feasible of a solution this would be. In my mind, this would require some sort of blanket licensing system coupled with AI authentication of the lineage of digital art. Could we automate royalties for this? Is this at all possible or too difficult to scale?

 I’d love to hear thoughts! Sorry for my lack of technical understanding.",Subpoena_coladaa,5,2,https://cointelegraph.com/news/can-blockchain-solve-the-ownership-debacle-over-ai-generated-art/amp

Are there any auto-approve PR bots out there?,"I'm looking for one that makes it look like I did it. It would only be for a specific engineer.

He's my lead and he has very few bugs in his code, so the risk of approving anything particularly bad is not high.

That said, he's extremely proud, a favorite of one of the higher ups, and in his late 30s/early 40s. There's no real way to approach changing the way he does things. Efforts approaching Acts of God are need to be made for him to budge inches on any change he makes. If I argue with him, it just ends up looking petty and bicycle sheddy. Most of the engineers are kinda doing the same at this point. He wants every PR he creates reviewed immediately.

After 6 months of trying to get him to make small changes, I'm kinda like there's other ways I can focus making an impact, but I still want the CYA of that green approval. I don't really want to spend my time reviewing things that are practically set in stone.",marc_polo,10,2,https://github.com/marketplace/actions/auto-approve

Reducing digital/online presence,"Let me start off by saying I’m a novice with computers and don’t understand how the internet works.

This summer I plan to reduce my electronic possessions down to just an iPhone and a Nintendo switch

I want to reduce the amount of apps and accounts I have down to just essentials. Banking, travel, email, bills, social media, google, apple, Spotify and maybe Netflix

Is there a way to search what websites have my email on record so I can delete the accounts? my “saved passwords” list is like 200 long and realistically I want to get that number down to around 10 in an effort to be online less and more connected to the real word

I figure the people here have a pretty solid understanding of the online/digital world so you’d know how to escape it better then most",AlienSpaceDog69,2,2,http://google.com

What’s the best way to learn C++?,"Hello, I have a couple of questions about c++ devlopment that I can't find answers to. 
How can I learn C++ programming without university so that I can get a decent job.  (Unfortunately, I do not have the opportunity to go to study at the university).
Can you advise some online courses that can be quoted when applying for a job.  For a while I tried to learn programming myself using courses on YouTube, but they don’t prepare you close to the desired level, they don’t tell you about some nuances or simply don’t give you the knowledge to write a simple program, in any case, you will need to dig on the Internet yourself  and read just a ton of literature about some basic things, it seems to me.
My girlfriend was able to enter the university and she is doing programming there, I see how much the level of teaching differs.

I will be extremely grateful if you can help me with this situation.",Ok-Sandwich-8876,23,2,http://programming.com
Looking for collaborators for my GitHub projects,"Hi everyone! I'm a developer with a few projects on GitHub that I'm working on, and I'm looking for collaborators to join me in making them even better. The projects I'm currently working on are color-predictor, ansible-practice and terraform-practice. They're all in various stages of development, and I could use some extra help with coding, testing, documentation, and other tasks.

If you're interested in contributing to any of these projects, or if you just want to learn more about them, please let me know in the comments or send me a DM. I'm open to working with developers of all skill levels, and I'm happy to provide guidance and feedback as needed.

We just took loops and if-else statement and as well switch case , arrays and some fundamentals like variables
And this is making me go crazy how would a be a great programmer and be able to make big program with only these things
Btw I’m a beginner in programming world C was my first language..

Coding a tool to get market place data,"Hello,

My idea was to create a tool that extracts market place data from the New World Market and write it to a txt for example.

I’m only trying to learn how it would work to maybe Code a tool like this.

The question is, how can I do that. Is it possible to somehow send a request to the server and get the market prices. I only know it’s possible using a api, but for New World there is now api. Another solution would be a bot that „clicks“ on the different items and get the data, but how could I get the data and where is it stored.

These are more theoretical questions of how this works and how other games like guild wars 2 and world of Warcraft do it for example.

I only worked with Cheat engine a few times to read the memory and that would be a solution, but this would require me manually opening the market board if I’m right.

I found a side that has this data, but I don’t know how they get it :)",ArktikusR,4,2,http://nwmarketprices.com

2D particle simulation in C++,This is a particle simulation that I have been writing in C++. Each particle has its own mass and all the interactions are based on Kinematic equations and equation for gravity. A direct calculation for the gravity on all particles has a time complexity of O(n^2) and with some optimizations O(1/2*n^2). This implementation I am currently working on uses a grid and only calculates gravity for all particles in adjacent grid cells. I am still working on an approach to calculate gravity on particles that are further away. One approach I think that I will implement is to have multiple different sized grids that will then have the mass of all the grid cells in it and calculate the force of gravity with less and less accuracy as it is further away. Please give me feedback on my code I am eager to get better!,Maleficent_Call840,33,2,https://github.com/cmcdev-code/Physics

Challenge Your Vocabulary with Lexi Challenge – A Game Developed with 100% Assistance from ChatGPT,"I have just finished developing a web game. This game was developed 100% using code generated by ChatGPT. This approach allowed for great flexibility in creating the game, as the language model is capable of generating code in response to user requests. This method of development also allowed for the rapid addition of new features to the game in response to user feedback.

LexiChallenge is available online at the website www.lexichallenge.com. The game is free and does not require registration.

The primary objective was to validate that ChatGPT could develop a complete solution. The configuration of all servers (REST API, TOMCAT, etc.) was also carried out by ChatGPT.
